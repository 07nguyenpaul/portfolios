# Brennan Holtzclaw Module 1 Portfolio

# My Mission

My goal coming in to Turing was to explore a new adventure. That goal quickly changed to learning as much as possible, as quickly as I can.
I feel like this first module has taught me a huge amount about the basics of working in Ruby, and I look forward to exploring more in the world of programming and design.


## End of Module Assessment
My first pass through the end of module assessment went OK, but I got a 2 in "Blocks and Enumerators" (which, sadly, was not offset by the 4 in collaboration). I took that assessment with Mike. My second pass through was with Horace, his notes and scores are below.

#### Notes
Assessed By: Horace

Challenge: Multipliers

Result: Repeat

Notes:
* TDD is quite strong; using it to get feedback
out of the problem
* Ruby construction / control flow -- working with classes
and objects and methods etc.
* Enums still a little shaky, and wrapped up with this
is a little trouble with identifying the core of
an algorithm or problem-solving process
* Working with object relationships and graphs seems
to come pretty naturally, but I would like to see more
repetitions and practice with the enum and problem-solving
fundamentals
* Make sure to keep running tests (or at least running something)
frequently
* Keep working on writing pseudocode that lends itself
to clean expression with code


#### Scores

Ruby Syntax & API: 3
Ruby Style: 3
Blocks & Enumerations: 2
Testing: 3
Workflow: 3
Collaboration: 3

## Attendance
I didn't miss any days of class in Module 1


# Projects

Below is a list of the myriad projects we did in Module 1. The first four projects were completed solo, while the last two were done with a pairing partner.

### Sorting Suite
Sorting Suite was our first project. In it we explored how sorting data in an array happens behind the scenes. No `.sort` here. Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort were the three styles expected to be written.
We were reviewed by other students on this project, and I was reviewed by JP. His notes are below.

#### Notes
https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/sortingsuite

* Student had prior commitment for out of state wedding. Existing code is good, but couldn't realistically get as deep into the project as hoped.

Functional Expectations: 2

* 2 sort classes working as expected. Bubble and insertion completed, run correctly. Algorithms are concise and clear.

Testing: 2

* Only 1 test for each, testing if sort works, but functional, passes, and name describes behavior. Format/conventions are good.

Ruby Style: 3

* Algorithms are neat and easy to read, as are tests. Variable names are easy to understand. Would be 4 except that there isn't enough complex code to try to evaluate.

Organization: 3

* Has separate directories for test and sort files. Not "lib/bin/test" specifically, but clearly separated. Uploaded to git as well with single branch.

#### Scores

Functionality: 2
Testing: 2
Ruby Style: 3
Organization 3

### Binary Search Tree
Binary Search Tree took the idea of a linked list one step further. Instead of only knowing one piece of information, each node knew what was to it's left and right. This creates a little tree, and I treated each "node" as it's own tree, solving this particular project with recursion.

#### Notes
Instructor: Mike

Repository:
http://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/binary-search-tree

Comments:
* 33 runs, 36 assertions, one failure.
* Treated nodes as their own trees.

#### Scores
Functional Expectations: 2
Test-Driven Development: 3
Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 2
Enumerable & Collections: 3


## Night Writer
Night Writer was supposed to be a project that could take in braille and output alpha-numerics, and vice-versa. The braille was input on three lines, with one character being made up of two symbols (a `.` or a `0`) on three seperate lines.
For a reason that I still haven't figured out, I struggled, greatly with this project. The results were, in the words of Horace, "...kind of a blood bath."

#### Notes
Assessed By: Horace

Github Repo: https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/night-writer

Comments:
* Not a lot of progress; many issues seemed to come up during development causing process to stall heavily.

* Need to focus going forward on carving out smaller pieces of the problem to make definitive progress.

* Some of the struggles seemed to stem from rehashing the same pieces multiple times; testing might be a good way to check these off and allow us to move on to other pieces.

#### Scores
Overall Functionality - 1
Fundamental Ruby & Style - 1
Test-Driven Development - 1
Breaking Logic into Components - 1

## Complete Me
This project takes the Binary Search Tree a step further. We built a "Trie" which could have n-branches, instead of two like BST. Using the ever expanding trie we built an autocomplete feature that would take an input of a word-fragment, and return all possible words that could "auto-complete" from that.

#### Notes
Instructor: Horace

Repository: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/complete_me_spec_harness

Comments:
* Basic functionality is all there

* Some concerns around internalizing concepts vs. achieving functional objectives

* Test numbers seem ok

* Solution is overall quite clean; possibly too clean; might have developed greater understanding through trying more sloppy solutions

* Node class is getting a little big; maybe there is opportunity to trim it by either extracting another class or reducing unnecessary cases

#### Scores
Functional Expectations: 3
TDD: 3
Ruby Style & Fundamentals: 3
Encapsulation / Breaking Logic Into Components: 3
Enumerable & Collections: 3

## HTTP Yeah You Know Me
In this project we did something that the internet told us not to do at every step of the way. We built a small HTTP server, and a small game, using only Ruby. Even though stack overflow would have just had us learn Rails or Sinatra, we persevered and got something built.

This was our first pair-project, and my partner was Dan Winter. Dan and I matched each-other's speed quite well, which probably helped us get full functionality on the project, but that came at the cost of testing, which was practically non-existant.

#### Notes
Group: Daniel Winter and Brennan Holtzclaw

Assessed By: Mike

Github: http://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/http_yeah

Notes:
* 24 tests, 10 failures

* some opportunities to refactor for clarity

* very light testing, needs to cover common edge cases, did not drive development.

* extraneous files in repo

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

#### Scores
Overall Functionality: 3

Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

Test-Driven Development: 1

Breaking Logic into Components: 3

## Headcount
As of the current writing of this portfolio, this project is still underway.

My pair this time around is Beth Sebian. Beth and I seem to be on even-ground when it comes to understanding and processing new information. We were determined to pseudo-code to our heart's content and make sure that we knew exactly what we're doing at each step. While I think this makes me the most confident in this project of any-other, it may have also cost us valuable time for completing functionality in the time given.

# Community

## Giving feedback
Below is some feedback from my fellow students:

"Over the course of the module, I’ve come to know Brennan as a consistently positive presence in the Turing community. He displays excellent leadership qualities, and actively engages others. As a programmer, I’ve seen that Brennan is extremely capable and displays great organizational skills, excelling at breaking up large problems into a logical workflow." -J

“Brennan is one of the calmest and kindest people I have ever met. He is always willing to help when asked. He is such an important part of our cohort." -B

## Being a community member
During my first module here at Turing I've mostly just tried to get used to the flow of the action, and figure out where I can fit in.
I recently took the lead on pushing up a Turing podcast. The first episode with Jorge Tellez has been posted on SoundCloud, and if all goes well a second episode with Jeff Casimir should be posted quite soon.

# Review
I don't know if I understand what information goes here.
