### Playing a Part

* On Saturday, July 18, I attended a Turing bike ride with 3 other Turing staff. I rode 20 miles on my fixie in my PJs with no water. It was more fun than it sounds.
* On Sunday, July 19, I attended a Turing fly fishing trip with 3 other Turing students and staff. We didn't catch a damn thing all day and thought we lost Horace to the wild, but RMNP is beautiful, so it's cool.
* On Tuesday, August 4, I organized and will oversee a Turing fantasy football league of 12 students & staff. I'm already brainstorming what to do with my first place winnings.
* On Saturday, August 8, I led a scrabble prep class attended by 4 other Turing students. We made it rain triple word scores.
