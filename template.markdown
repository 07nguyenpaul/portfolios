### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to really understand and apply what we covered in module 2.  Because of my wedding at the end of module 2 I don't think I got everything I could have out of Dinner Dash, and that frustrated me a bit.  While I understood the theory of what we did, my understanding of the application was not the most solid.  So I set out to fix this.  

I also set out to create tools that I could use to make this easier to do.  I have created several "Rails Cheats" that I use to guide me through projects and have also branched out into exploring different gems and tools that are available in rails.

(In this project, we'll use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.)

(Project fails more than 4 spec harness tests
Project makes good use of ActiveRecord to fulfill Business Reqs, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods
Project uses idiomatic Ruby with a handful of larger methods or bloated controllers
Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features
Project focuses tests on only a single layer of the stack, or has large gaps in the coverage)

(
Completion: 1
Rails and ActiveRecord Style: 3
Ruby Style and Code Quality: 2.5
