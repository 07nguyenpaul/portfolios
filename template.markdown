### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to complete every project with a score of three or higher in every category. I focused on test driven development (tdd) and object oriented programming. I focused on writing rigorously tested clean code. I worked to break problems down into smaller and more fundamental components in order to complete larger projects.

### Work

I completed the following projects: Robodoku, CompleteMe, ParaMorse, Battleship, and Black Thursday.

#### Robodoku

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PlanetEfficacy/roboduko)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/robodoku-template)
* [Blog Post] (http://www.jessespevack.com/systems-leadership/2016/7/2/75u8n0im73hd27a4yclc98qzl6hivu)

Roboduko is about writing a sudoku solving program that takes in a simple sudoku puzzle as a .txt file and outputs the resulting solved puzzle as text.

This project was not formally assessed.

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/planetefficacy/CompleteMe)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)
* [Blog Post] (http://www.jessespevack.com/systems-leadership/2016/7/5/turing-school-of-software-design-module-1-week-2)

CompleteMe is a rudimentary autocomplete program that first loads in a dictionary of words and then can take in a prefix and return words from the dictionary that begin with the prefix. The project gets a little spicier with the notion of weighted suggestions whereby the program needs to also store the user's preferences regarding a given prefix so that next time that prefix is given, the user's past selected words are prioritized over other words.

(evaluation comments)
Spec harness 2.3 seconds
Good testing, could check for more edge cases
Recursive methods are well done
Would liked to have seen a separate Trie class
Some opportunities to refactor, we talked about predicate methods
