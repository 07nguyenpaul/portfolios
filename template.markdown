# Justin Holmes - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My main area of focus was to get better at Rails.  While I felt ok with it by
the end of M2, I still wanted to strive for mastery and demonstrate best
practices.  I also used this module (and the break before starting) to get
my feet wet with javascript and slowly start to become more comfortable with
using it.

### End of Module Assessment


### Attendance

I have not missed a day during M3, or have been tardy. I will miss a day on
Friday, Aug. 14th for a wedding.
