### Your Mission

I set out to really understand and apply what we covered in module 2.  Because of my wedding at the end of module 2 I don't think I got everything I could have out of Dinner Dash, and that frustrated me a bit.  While I understood the theory of what we did, my understanding of the application was not the most solid.  So I set out to fix this.  

I also set out to create tools that I could use to make this easier to do.  I have created several "Rails Cheats" that I use to guide me through projects and have also branched out into exploring different gems and tools that are available in rails.

### Attendance

### Work

(Intro)

#### APICurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RMCornell/api_curious_instagram)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

In this project, we'll be focusing on consuming and working with data from public APIs. As a vehicle for learning this concepts, we'll be selecting an API from a popular website and working to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API. For example, you might decide to use the Twitter API to build a basic version of the Twitter feed where users can view and post tweets.

### Comments
* Project fails more than 4 spec harness tests
* Project makes good use of ActiveRecord to fulfill Business Reqs, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods
* Project uses idiomatic Ruby with a handful of larger methods or bloated controllers
* Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features
* Project focuses tests on only a single layer of the stack, or has large gaps in the coverage)

### Scores
* Completion: 1
* Rails and ActiveRecord Style: 3
* Ruby Style and Code Quality: 2.5

#### RalesEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RMCornell/ralesengine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rales_engine.markdown)

In this project, we'll use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

Your Dinner Dash is getting somewhere, but our investors have decided that serving orders out of a single restaurant is never going to get us to the scale we'd like to see. What we need is a platform.
