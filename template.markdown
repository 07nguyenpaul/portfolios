### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to complete every project with a score of three or higher in every category. I focused on test driven development (tdd) and object oriented programming. I focused on writing rigorously tested clean code. I worked to break problems down into smaller and more fundamental components in order to complete larger projects.

### Work

I completed the following projects: Robodoku, CompleteMe, ParaMorse, Battleship, and Black Thursday.

#### Robodoku

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PlanetEfficacy/roboduko)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/robodoku-template)
* [Blog Post] (http://www.jessespevack.com/systems-leadership/2016/7/2/75u8n0im73hd27a4yclc98qzl6hivu)

##### Description
Roboduko is about writing a sudoku solving program that takes in a simple sudoku puzzle as a .txt file and outputs the resulting solved puzzle as text.

This project was not formally assessed.

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/planetefficacy/CompleteMe)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)
* [Blog Post] (http://www.jessespevack.com/systems-leadership/2016/7/5/turing-school-of-software-design-module-1-week-2)

##### Description
CompleteMe is a rudimentary autocomplete program that first loads in a dictionary of words and then can take in a prefix and return words from the dictionary that begin with the prefix. The project gets a little spicier with the notion of weighted suggestions whereby the program needs to also store the user's preferences regarding a given prefix so that next time that prefix is given, the user's past selected words are prioritized over other words.

##### Evaluation Comments
* Spec harness 2.3 seconds
* Good testing, could check for more edge cases
* Recursive methods are well done
* Would liked to have seen a separate Trie class
* Some opportunities to refactor, we talked about predicate methods
##### Evaluation Scores
* Functional Expectations - 3: Application fulfills all base expectations
* Test-Driven Development - 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components - 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* Fundamental Ruby & Style - 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* Enumerable & Collections - 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### ParaMorse

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/planetefficacy/paramorse)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/paramorse.markdown)
* [Blog Post] (http://www.jessespevack.com/systems-leadership/2016/7/14/what-i-learned-failing-my-paramorse-project)

##### Description
ParaMorse is about building a program to interpret Morse code, the mid nineteenth century set of signals used to communicate over distances via telegraph. The project is called ParaMorse because the crux of the challenge is to handle parallel streams of code that intertwine to form a single message.

##### Evaluation Comments
* Did not complete I7
* 56 tests
* Good use of predicate methods
* Some larger methods
* good effort towards breaking things down
##### Evaluation Scores
* Overall Functionality - 2: Application converts to and back successfully
* Fundamental Ruby & Style - 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* Test-Driven Development - 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* Breaking Logic into Components - 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/PlanetEfficacy/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown#player-ship-placement)
* [Blog Post] (http://www.jessespevack.com/systems-leadership/2016/7/21/all-your-battleship-are-belong-to-us)

##### Description
Code a playable version of Milton Bradley's Battleship that runs in a Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL).

##### Evaluation Comments
* Watch those negated method calls (!is_valid?)
* Includes picking levels, started adding AI
* Solid use of enumerables, best choice most often
* TDD the whole way, beautiful test suite!
* Rules module -- great example of breaking logic and responsibilities apart
##### Evaluation Scores
* Fundamental Ruby & Style - 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* Enumerable & Collections - 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
* Test-Driven Development - 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
* REPL Interface - 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the gameplay
* Breaking Logic into Components - 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components such that individual pieces could be reused or replaced without difficulty

##### Description
A business is only as smart as its data. Let's build a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business.
