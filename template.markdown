## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module has been tough personally for me. I set out to learn rails inside out, build and query APIs with ease, and learn how to create and execute complex SQL queries using SQL and ActiveRecord.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

##### 1. Ruby Style

* 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
* **3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components**
* 2: Developer writes effective code, but does not breakout logical components
* 1: Developer writes code with unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity
* 0: Developer writes code that is difficult to understand

##### 2. Rails Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
* **3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.**
* 2: Developer struggles with some concepts of MVC.  Developer is not confident in what every line of the code is doing or cannot speak to the choices made.
* 1: Developer struggles with MVC and pushing logic down the stack
* 0: Developer shows little or no understanding of how to craft Rails applications

##### 3. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. All new lines of code are tested.
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.
* **2: Developer writes tests. Most new lines of code are tested but they aren't effective at testing for functionality and value.**
* 1: Developer is able to write tests, but most new lines of code are not tested.
* 0: Developer does not use tests.

##### 4. Progression/Completion

* 4: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a developer.
* 3: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.
* **2: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of an apprentice.**

* 3: Developer commits almost every 15 minutes
* 2: Developer does not commit regularly
* 1: Developer has poor git workflow and does not commit regularly
* 0: Developer committed once

### Work

The group projects this mod were great, and challenging. I felt like I really came into my own in leadership qualities and implementation of features. I feel like I do my best work in groups when I am able to play my strengths with the strengths of others, but I also took opportunities to shore up my weaknesses when I saw fit.
Solitary projects (limited to APICurious this mod) on the other hand were a little more difficult for me, and a definite place for improvement to occur. I plan to revisit APICurious, Rales Engine testing, and the final assessment over break week.

#### ApiCurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/zackforbing/apicurious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

ApiCurious was a difficult project for me. As has been a relatively common issue for me, I had a hard time defining my process and taking the first few bites of the elephant. Once I got started, it went fairly smoothly, but I did not end up putting as much time into it as I would have liked. I plan to remedy this over break week, and finish the project to my own satisfaction, now having more experience dealing with serving up APIs through the final assessment and the FareHarbor project.

##### Evaluation

This project was not evaluated for a grade.

## Team

### Projects

As I said above, the group projects this mod were really good to me. I took risks and shored up perceived weaknesses where I could, and I feel like I was integral to my groups' successes.

#### The Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/karinamzalez/the_pivot_1605)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

The Pivot, despite feeling like a bit of a drag since we were basically working on the same project for a month, was a turning point for me. I acknowledged my lack of leadership experience after Little Shop, and I decided that taking the project manager position was something that I needed to do. My group wasn't opposed to this, and I received glowing praise from them in this position. We were beseiged by a myriad of strange errors the day of our assessment, which caused us to miss the polish we would have had otherwise, and also caused the 2 we received in user experience.

##### The Pivot Feedback

  From Karina:
  In my opinion, Zach is the best team leader in all of the lands. haha
  I was lucky to experience him in his first leadership position at Turing and I feel confident in saying that he did an amazing job. Zach has this way of being diplomatic about all of the decisions he makes, he makes sure he listens to every one of his team mate's opinions before moving forward and that is something I deeply respect. He also had this way of reining us all in and reminding us all of the most pressing task at hand. I do believe Zach should be more consistent with the breaks that he takes in between long hours of coding-- being nice to our bodies is chill. I believe Zach should seek out more leadership opportunities because he seems to be a natural at it.

  From Kris S:
  "You did a great job as project manager. Your commitment was substantial. You communciated in a clear and consice manner. You managed the project well while allowing each member to contribute and be creative. Feel confident in expressing your valuable and competent ideas regarding the direction of any project. You have great ideas and will do well to take on more leadership roles. Also, continue to watch out for those 'rabbit holes' that we mutually need to avoid. You are an asset to our team and the community." -Kris

  From Chris C:
  Thank you for leading the group. You did a good job with prioritizing our tasks and making sure we were on track. Excellent communication via Slack. Your github workflow is great for a team environment. The only criticism I have is that perhaps you would benefit from time-boxing tasks on which you are working. If you hit a time limit, pass it off to a group member or pair with a group member to get to completion. Your contributions were great, especially with the refactoring and test-writing. I enjoyed working together!

##### RalesEngine Feedback

    From Yoseph:
    Zack, you were awesome as you always are. Working with you and being able to solve problems made the whole experience worth while. I really admired those moments when you wouldn’t know what to do, but then suddenly thought of an idea and wanted to try it. The one thing that became a setback for time was when you were hanging out with your friend (completely reasonable to do so, lol) during the project crunch time, but I have to admit that it was awesome seeing you setback for time then powering through it. Also, I think you would benefit from would be to stop smoking (person attack, charge!). But all joking aside, I really enjoyed working with you and hope that you keep being you, dude! I’ve seen you grow from Day 1, and it was awesome to be able to work on this project with you!

### Giving Feedback

#### The Pivot Feedback

To Karina:
Karina - Your code contributions are smart and invaluable to our project. Your work on the weather api, css, and business_items were particularly awesome. And you were there to help calm me down when I was stressed out. However, I'd like to see you be a little more consistent in your communication and attendance. I know that some things happened that were outside of your control, but I think that there were more beneficial actions for the group that you decided not to take. Your coding ability is strong, but I know you'll be even better if you can demonstrate a little more consistency.

To Kris S:
Kris, your communication during the project was stellar - you were always available when you said you would be. Your coding ability is the same. You show incredible aptitude and hunger, and pairing with you was always a great experience. I think you showed a lot of growth in your knowledge, ability, and confidence throughout this project, and I'd love to see you take on a leadership role on a future project. I think that would be of great benefit to you, and one of your few shaky points. You were a workhorse, coming in early most every day and staying late several days. Your commitment to the project was admirable. don't lose that hunger, but also don't forget to take pomodoros every once in a while! Overall, without you, I don't think we would have gotten nearly as far, and it would have been much more stressful.

To Chris C:
Chris, your intuition on ruby is something I have come to trust. Your ability is very strong, and I applaud your can-do attitude towards doing things that might be a little difficult at first, like using haml or taking on CSS. Despite being gone for the weekend, I felt like your contributions to the project were proportional, and I was very glad you had the foresight to preview the site a bit while the rest of us were down testing rabbit-holes on the last day. Your instincts are on point, but I think you have a bit of lone-wolf personality, and I know that it would help cement things for you, as well as help improve others, if you spent more time pairing. I realized over the weekend with Kris Sparks just how much we can accomplish when we put our heads together, and when you did join us I felt like we were even more unstoppable. It's just really beneficial to see how others think around a problem, as there's rarely ever one single solution to a problem. Overall, I feel you were an invaluable part of our team!

#### RalesEngine Feedback

To Yoseph:
Yoseph, you were absolutely instrumental to our team on RalesEngine. Your ability to explain your process really helped me to form my own process for building the business intelligence endpoints. In the future, though, I think you might benefit from stepping away from issues you are having. I know the test suite was a point of frustration for you, and I think we might have come to a better solution if we stepped away from the problem and regrouped. Overall, you are a hard worker, and I know it's hard to remove your focus when you are hitting a problem, but taking a walk has been incredibly beneficial for me, and I hope it will be for you too.

### Being a Community Member

I did not receive any feedback from the community.

### Playing a Part

Aside from my dishwasher duty on Wednesdays, I took time to take care of them whenever I noticed dishes stacking up. I also participated in Imposters as well as Miyamoto posse. I also offered brief impromptu pairings with mod 1 students.
