### Work

This module I worked on Chisel and Linked Lists individually.

#### Linked List

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbrr/linked_list)  
[Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

I was evaluated by Jeff and got the following scores:

1. Functional Expectations                       : 3
2. Test-Driven Development                       : 3
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style                      : 3
5. Looping *or* Recursion                        : 3

#### Chisel

[GitHub ](https://github.com/jbrr/chisel)  
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

I was evaluated by Mike and got the following scores:

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style      : 3
2. Test-Driven Development       : 2
3. Functionality                 : 3
4. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

It wasn't strong on TDD, and I made that a goal for later projects.
