### Submission

A pull request with your submission must be made at least 12 hours before your
scheduled defense. Non-conforming formats, filenames, or directories will be
rejected and your defense rescheduled.

### Filename & Directory

The file should be
saved in the format `"date-name-completing.markdown"` where:

* `date` is the last day of the module in compressed year/month/day, like `20150831`
* `name` is your first and last name like `jeff_casimir`
* `completing` is the module that you're completing, like `m4`

So a complete filename might look like `20150831-jeff_casimir-m4.markdown`. This
file needs to be stored in a directory `portfolios/students/your_name` where
`your_name` is like `jeff_casimir`.

If you were completing Module 4 on August 31, 2015 and your name was Jeff Casimir, 
your portfolio submission would reside at the following location: `portfolios/students/jeff_casimir/20150831-jeff_casimir-m4.markdown`.
