### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to really understand and apply what we covered in module 2.  Because of my wedding at the end of module 2 I don't think I got everything I could have out of Dinner Dash, and that frustrated me a bit.  While I understood the theory of what we did, my understanding of the application was not the most solid.  So I set out to fix this.  

I also set out to create tools that I could use to make this easier to do.  I have created several "Rails Cheats" that I use to guide me through projects and have also branched out into exploring different gems and tools that are available in rails.

### Work

(Intro)

#### APICurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RMCornell/api_curious_instagram)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

In this project, we'll be focusing on consuming and working with data from public APIs. As a vehicle for learning this concepts, we'll be selecting an API from a popular website and working to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API. For example, you might decide to use the Twitter API to build a basic version of the Twitter feed where users can view and post tweets.

### Comments
* Project fails more than 4 spec harness tests
* Project makes good use of ActiveRecord to fulfill Business Reqs, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods
* Project uses idiomatic Ruby with a handful of larger methods or bloated controllers
* Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features
* Project focuses tests on only a single layer of the stack, or has large gaps in the coverage)

### Scores
* Completion: 1
* Rails and ActiveRecord Style: 3
* Ruby Style and Code Quality: 2.5
* API Design: 3
* Test Driven Design: 2


#### RalesEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/RMCornell/ralesengine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rales_engine.markdown)

In this project, we'll use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

#### SupperSkip

Your Dinner Dash is getting somewhere, but our investors have decided that serving orders out of a single restaurant is never going to get us to the scale we'd like to see. What we need is a platform.

### Feedback
 * "You were super easy to work with, you knew your stuff, and I liked working with you a lot."
 * "Rob does a good job of approaching problems piece by piece and breaking them down. I’m glad he’s a part of my cohort and value what he brings to the group."
 * "It's being really great! No complaints, really easy to work with and get feedback! able to work as part of a team and collaborate without pushing your ideas. Also, great giving out ideas to implement in an easy and understanble way. =D
 * I’ve had the pleasure of working with Rob on two group projects. He’s always got something interesting to talk about and he’s fun to work with. Rob is always super calm and level-headed when you work with him which is such a great thing in high-stress situations. On the code side of things he rocks too! He’s really smart and knows his shit. I especially liking working with Rob when trying to figure out the logic for how to do something or troubleshooting problems, he’s great at walking through the process/steps of what the code is doing and finding the pain points.
