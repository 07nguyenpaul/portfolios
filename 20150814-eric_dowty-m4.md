# Eric Dowty - Module 4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My biggest emphasis coming into module 4 in order of precedence were ensuring I had accepted a job offer, improving test driven JavaScript development, building a project with socket.io, and learning a JavaScript front end framework. 

### End of Module Assessment

Not completed yet.

### Attendance

I missed one day at Turing on the 17th of July to go to a day long job interview at Invoca in Boulder, CO.

### Projects

#### Idea Box 2.0

I did not get assessed on Idea Box 2.0 because it was never ready for production and I was not happy with the product. I actually did 2 iterations of this project. I stopped developing the first iteration when I realized that I had lots and lots of JavaScript code that was untested. I stopped developing the second iteration (review GitHub URL below) after spending almost 2 weeks trying to develop a framework of my own for asynchronous JavaScript code using a mix of MagicCarpet and Mocha-Chai repositories. Handling state while testing multiple AJAX calls proved difficult, although I am confident with more time I will be able to build a system that works well.

#### Scale Up

I did not get assessed on the Scale Up. I did complete building the seed file and the load script on my own, however, by the time I was ready to start optimization I was gearing up for my job interview with Invoca. I made a judgement call to spend the days I would have been optimizing the Scale Up prepping for my interview. The interview coincidentally was on the same day as the Scale Up assessment. GitHub URL is below for review.

## Team

### Projects

  I participated in the following team projects:

#### Game Time (2048)

  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

  This week-and-a-half long project was a pure JavaScript implementation of a
  simple game. In our case that game was Lights Out. It was evaluated by Horace
  with the following results:

  "This is actually fun."

  * Functional Expectations 3-
  * Test-Driven Development 2
  * Breaking Logic into Components 3
  * Fundamental JavaScript & Style 3 -->

##### My Contribution

##### Takeaway

<!--   * OO JS is just a matter of organization
  * TDD is mostly self discipline
  * Project management tools are useful even in a team of two
 -->
#### Turing Scavenger Hunt

<!--   * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/indiesquidge/quibble)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flack.markdown) -->

<!--   This two week mastery project was a demonstration of websockets and software as
  a service through a Slack clone. Our particular project aimed to provide a
  structure for groups to come to decisions. We were evaluated by Horace with the
  following results:

  * Services 2:
  * Encapsulation 2:
  * Rails MVC 3:
  * Test-Driven Development 2:
  * Deployment 3:
  * Features 3:
  * Interface 3:
  * Concept 3:
  * Project Management process 3: -->

##### My Contribution

##### Takeaway

<!--   * Code review is key to writing great software
  * Being the team member who touches everything forces you to keep a lot in your
  head at once.
  * Pick your battles. Let some design decisions go. -->

  * On Friday, May 22nd, I delivered a lightning talk titled "Metaprogramming is
  Meta cool!"
  * On Tuesday, June 9th, I delivered an expanded version of my metaprogramming
  lightning talk at the Denver.rb beginner's track
  * On Friday, June 12th, I ran a student lead session on JavaScript for Rubyists

  Community Night
