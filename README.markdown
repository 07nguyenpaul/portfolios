# Portfolios

In order to earn promotion to the next module or graduation you need to complete,
submit, and defend your portfolio.

A submission summarizes your accomplishments in these key areas:

* Individual
* Team
* Community

## Note on Feedback for Week of 8/14

For the module cycle ending the week of 8/14 we're still in the process of
implementing a robust feedback system. For the feedback prompts you should do
the best you can to characterize feedback you've received and given. It'd be
ideal to gather your own quotes from teammates/classmates either via submitted
anonymous feedback you've received or directly asking them for feedback.

Here are some notes about expectations for this cycle:

### Module 1

* Individual Assessment: Yes
* Required Project: SalesEngine
* Included Projects: Enigma, (Linked List & Chisel for Foxtrot), (Robodoku & SalesEngine the SQL)
* Feedback: Self-Solicited

### Module 2

* Individual Assessment: Tuesday & Wednesday
* Required Project: None
* Included Projects: TrafficSpy, Little Shop of Orders
* Feedback: May have some feedback from TrafficSpy and LSoO if delivered

### Module 3

* Individual Assessment: Only if needed
* Required Project: Self-Directed Project
* Included Projects: APIcurious, Rales Engine, The Pivot
* Feedback: Self-Solicited

### Module 4

* Individual Assessment: Yes
* Required Project: Mastery Project
* Included Projects: GameTime, ScaleUp
* Feedback: Self-Solicited

## Authoring Process

* Carefully read the `submission_guidelines.markdown` to understand how your
portfolio should be written/submitted
* Read a sample portfolio in `sample.markdown` in this repo
* Copy the content of `template.markdown` as a starting point
* Fill in and submit your own content.

## Evaluation Process

Your portfolio will be evaluated in the last week of the module by a panel of
at least two instructors. During this 15-minute session the reviewers will:

* Read your portfolio
* Ask questions
* Use the rubric (`rubric.markdown`) to assess the quality of your work
* Render a promotion decision
* Record notes and the decision in your portfolio

## Outcomes

Portfolio evaluations have three possible outcomes:

* *PROMOTED* - your portfolio demonstrates a successful fulfillment of expectations
and you may move on to the next module or graduate
* *RETAINED* - your portfolio is lacking in one or more areas and you may either
repeat the current module or leave the program
* *EXCUSED* - your portfolio is lacking in one or more areas and either (a) you've
now failed to pass the module in two attempts or (b) the reviewers have determined
that you will not be successful at Turing
* *PENDING* - your portfolio is incomplete or non-conforming and will be re-evaluated
as soon as possible. If it is incomplete after 24 hours it will be moved to *RETAINED* or *EXCUSED*
