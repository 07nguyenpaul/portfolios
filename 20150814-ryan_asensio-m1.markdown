# (Ryan Asensio) - (M1) Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, I set out to test my limits in the depth and speed of learning.
I learned the basics of programming in Ruby, how to use GitHub, and how
relational databases are designed and implemented.

### Work

Following is a list of my individual and pair projects, completed in Module 1.
Projects are listed in chronological order, the most recent being located at the
bottom.

#### (Robodoku)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/Robodoku.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/robodoku.markdown)

This was our first project. We were asked to create a program that solves
sudoku puzzles. Although I successfully implemented this functionality, the
ruby syntax and style, demonstration of the SRP and DRY code, file organization,
test coverage and proper use of github was significantly lacking.


Evaluation scores (maximum out of 4)

Functional Expectations: 3.5
TDD: 3
Encapsulation: 3
Fundamental Ruby: 4
Enumerable: 3

#### (Binary Search Tree)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/Binary_search_tree)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/data_structures_and_algorithms/tree/master/binary_trees)

Our second project asked for the implementation of a Binary Search Tree, a data
structure that allows for fast searching in a Set of data. I was able to
solidify my understanding of recursive methods and improve on all aspects of
effective coding (syntax/style, SRP, DRYness, TDD, GitHub, file org, etc.)

Instructor Comments:

Program works
One extension - Max Depth
Clean code, some opportunities for refactoring, splitting out to separate methods.
