# Michael Dorrance - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I was excited to continue the momentum of Module 1 and move into learning how to build web applications using Sinatra and Rails. I had built Rails 3.2 apps a few years ago and really looked forward to pushing to Heroku again. After my first team project in Module 1, I learned that I needed to be more forward with expectations and planning for group projects.  Starting with Traffic Spy, as a group we developed user stories about what we were going to accomplish. I then used Balsamiq to create wireframes to verify with the group that we were all on the same page as far as url structure and content to be displayed. The interactive wireframes were a successful tool for our group to validate how the words we were reading would be transferred to the web.

I then asked the group if it was ok for me to build the html structure for each page using Bootstrap and they agreed. The ability to visually see placeholders for each piece of functionality was key to a very smooth and successful team project. We developed a plan and could see visually what the next step would be. An added benefit was that it was more fun to write the code when it looked good on the web. Our project workflow was smooth, fun and enjoyable.

### Playing a Part

I helped Lovisa with the 1507 Intro Class for 2 hours on the Thursday before the module started and then proceeded to meet them at the happy hour that day.

Fellow classmates from my module wanted to learn how to do wireframing and use Balsamiq for their projects after seeing the way they helped our Traffic Spy group with project management and design, so I led a student session on Friday July 24 titled:
* Breaking down problems with wireframes (Student-led session, 2-4pm)
  - Gain an understanding of the REAL user stories
  - Introduce wireframing tools and techniques
  - Lets break down the user stories with the classic project "Traffic Spy"
  - Build a clickable wireframe of Traffic Spy using Balsamiq

Fellow classmates also wanted to learn how to use Bootstrap so that they could then build responsive apps quicker and to transfer their wireframes to html and css so I led a student session on Friday August 7 titled:
* Bootstrap basics (Student-led session, 2-4pm)
  - Gain an understanding of what Bootstrap is
  - Introduce "Mobile First" design, the grid and components of Bootstrap
  - Workshop: Importing Bootstrap into a Rails Project
  - Workshop: Transferring a wireframe to html and css using Bootstrap
