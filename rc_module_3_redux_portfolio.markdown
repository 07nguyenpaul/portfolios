### Areas of Emphasis

I had a hard time getting started in this module, due in part to the fact that it was not clear to me on what I should be focusing on, having been held back to repeat this module. 

About three weeks in I was able to discuss with Jeff and Jorge how to approach repeating this module, and with that in mind, I worked on taking lessons to the next step as well as building my own apps and side projects. 

That having been said, my scores from this module were improved over last, and I was able to start delving into some deeper topics that will be covered in module 4.  Specifically, I challenged myself to write a decent amount of my final project in javascript and jquery, two things I had not really dabbled in until a week ago, which I now understand far better than I did before.

### Attendance

Didn't track attendance as closely as I could have.  I did spend much of work time away from Turing, due in part to the fact that I don't really like the new layout with classroom C being the quiet work room.  I preferred the spaces in the back of Classroom A because I prefer to work in relative isolation.  As a result, during work time I lit at Amante or Common Grounds and was very productive during those working sessions. 

I did miss some classes due to things with my kids being back in school and left early on several Wednesdays to attend my daughter's football games. 

### Work

(Intro)

#### APICurious

GitHub: github.com/RMCornell/alchemy Production: apicurious-tumblr.herokuapp.com

* [GitHub URL](github.com/RMCornell/alchemy)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

In this project, we'll be focusing on consuming and working with data from public APIs. As a vehicle for learning this concepts, we'll be selecting an API from a popular website and working to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API. For example, you might decide to use the Twitter API to build a basic version of the Twitter feed where users can view and post tweets.

### Comments
* Project makes good use of ActiveRecord to fulfill Business Reqs, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods
* Project uses idiomatic Ruby with a handful of larger methods or bloated controllers
* Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features
* Project focuses tests on only a single layer of the stack, or has large gaps in the coverage)

### Scores
* Completion: 2
  * Note: For this project I did not follow the rubric exactly, rather, added Tumblr functionality to an existing app that I had built during break and therefore had not looked at all the requirements. I did clear this with Jorge before doing it. 
  
* Organization: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3 || used an external service so coverage was lower than 80% but the things not tested were used by devise
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 3.5 -> 3

#### RalesEngine

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/rmcornell/rales)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rales_engine.markdown)

In this project, we'll use Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema.

### Comments
See below

### Scores
* Completion: 3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.
* Test-Driven Development: 3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
* Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
* API Design: 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
* Queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.

Your Dinner Dash is getting somewhere, but our investors have decided that serving orders out of a single restaurant is never going to get us to the scale we'd like to see. What we need is a platform.

(feedback to me)

â€œRob was a great team member. He communicated well with the status of his tasks and providing feedback on merge requests. He has solid programming skills and was fun to work with. Together we tackled some tasks and it was truly a successful collaborative effort. I would work on any project with Rob because he is professional, respectful and hard working."

## Community

I provided feedback to anyone who asked for it and continued to offer feedback to the Turing staff.  I scaled back on the weekly survey's this module due in part to the fact that I felt I had repeated myself significantly and didn't have anything new to add.  If I did have somethinng to add I would complete a survey. 

### Playing a Part

There were no opportunities for outreach this module that I was able to participate in   I did volunteer to be part of one that is coming up during the next module.  

One thing I did was work to connect with other 1503 students who were staying back to repeat the module, while also working to reach out to the new cohort members.  

I also continued to connect with people from 1502 who had graduated, specifically sending job openings to those who I knew were looking for jobs as I came across them. 

I attended two hiring events.  One with Motorola Solutions and one with SchoolRunner in Boulder.
