### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module is to build on the fountaions of Ruby and TDD that I learned in mod 1, and be able to bring these skills to the web with Rails.  I want to get very comfortable with the MVC model so that I will be able to learn different frameworks that use it.  I'm very interested in learning SQL, databases, and database relationships.  I also want to participate in the Turing community more than I did last module.

### Playing a Part

I did pairing sessions with Mod 1 students during the first weeks of the mod.  I found it to be both challenging and rewarding, guiding students was more difficult than I anticipated.  I also attended Denver Beta, a showcase for startups in the area, with another Mod 2 frontend student in my posse.
