# Dan Broadbent - M2 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module is to build on the fountaions of Ruby and TDD that I learned in mod 1, and be able to bring these skills to the web with Rails.  I want to get very comfortable with the MVC model so that I will be able to learn different frameworks that use it.  I'm very interested in learning SQL, databases, and database relationships.  I also want to participate in the Turing community more than I did last module.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)
Evaluator: Casey

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

* 4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement more than one solution in Ruby through refactoring

3. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs occasional guidance

4. MVC & Rails Style

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

Notes: Work on collaboration, I do a lot of processing in my head, so be sure to talk through what I'm doing out loud.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual work this module mainly consisted of working through different tutorials in order to learn the basic conventions of Ruby on Rails.  The only individual project where we had some freedom to work on things in our own way was Rails Mini-Project.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [Idea Box GitHub](https://github.com/danbroadbent/idea_box)
* [Rails Mini-Project Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

Idea Box is an app to record your ideas.  It allows users to create ideas and save them with a description to different categories.  This project was not formally evaluated, but the learning goals included test driven development of a rails app with feature tests, setting up CRUD functionality, using 1-to-1 and 1-to-many database realationships, using RESTful routes, and implementing authentication of users.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects were the highlight of this module.  I worked on two teams of three, and they both worked together very well.  In Rush Hour we build a Sinatra app, and Little Shops was built with Ruby on Rails.

#### Rush Hour

* [](Rush Hour GitHub)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md](Rush Hout Original Assignment)

Rush Hour was a web app built with Ruby, Sinatra, and Active Record.  It is a tool that aggregates and analyzes visitor data from another website.  Customer data was a payload in the form of a JSON object that we had to accept and anaylize.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

This was a very eye-opening session.  The idea that many jobs in the tech world are never even posted is really important to how you go about the job hunt.  Knowing what companies you are interested in and what kind of cultures they have is very important.  This gives you a way to start persuing those companies and finding common interests with people who already work there.

#### Networking with Lia

This session offered a lot of great strageies to be successful at networking and not see it as a chore.  

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

Since we had a couple of serious group projects this module, it was very helpful that the whole class went over communication strategies.  I found the most important and useful strategy that we went over was making your feedback objective and free of emotion, judgement, and assumptions.  This is beneficial for both the giver and reciever of the feedback as it keeps it from being taken in the wrong way and much more comfortable to give and accept.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Raphael - I was happy to have you as a partner on the Rush Hour project.  You brought a great energy to our group, and made it easy to stay and get work done when we were all on a roll.  You obviously have great technical skills, but beyond that your positive attitude helped us all tackle difficult challenges with relative ease because we were all on the same page and having fun working together.  This group worked very well together and your openness and communication was a big part of that.  Can’t wait to work with you again.

Brendan - I really enjoyed working with you on the Rush Hour project.  I felt you did a great job as project manager.  You allowed everyone to make their point about the direction the project should go, and made the best decision even when it wasn’t your own.  Your knowledge of what was going on in the project as a whole was impressive and allowed us to really make big breakthroughs quickly as a group.  The whole group had really great communication and we were able to address issues as the came up and keep things moving smoothly.  You were a great asset to the team and I hope I get to work with you again.

Matt - It was great getting to work with you on the Little Shop project and getting to know you better.  You are calm and collected and did a great job letting things go smoothly but also making your point known when there was a disagreement about where the direction should go.  You had a great understanding of the project and definitely taught us a few things about CSS.  You’re an awesome coder and easy to work with.  I’d be happy to have you in my group again.

Ryan - You were awesome to work with on the Little Shop project.  Your enthusiasm, energy, and creativity made what could have been potentially uninteresting project a lot of fun.  You did a great job listening to group input and keeping the group moving in the right direction.  There was also a specific instance where I felt that you could tell I didn’t quite understand the name-spacing technique we were using and you made sure I got the practice I needed to understand it.  You have a great ability to understand what is going on in the Rails app all at once, and are a great asset to the team.  I’m looking forward to working with you again, hopefully on something a little less structured.

### Being a Community Member

From Ryan - Dan, I am so glad we were placed in the same group for LittleShop.  Working on No Refunds has been one of the most enjoyable projects yet.  I know I've told you this in person, but your calm, easy-going personality is such a great balance for groups.  Specifically, I have learned a lot working with you.  As you know, I have a tendency to get a bit wound up when I get excited, you are really good at keeping the group's emotions down and, in turn, calm me down.  The one bit of advice I could give you though, is being calm can be a double-edged sword.  There were moments when I would ask how you were feeling about some of the code we were writing, and I think it would be beneficial if you spoke up a little more and expressed your opinions.  Overall though, you are a fantastic group member to work with and solid coder.  I'm glad we were able to get this website off the ground.  It's one of the first projects I am honestly proud to put my name on.

From Raphael - I paired with Dan during our Rush Hour Project. I absolutely enjoyed working with him, from challenging ideas, to bringing the group back to focus and making sure we wouldn't fall in unnecessary rabbit holes, Dan was such a joy to partner with, and I would be more than happy to work with him in the future. I feel like our group had an amazing rapport and worked together very well. My respect and admiration for Dan's ideas, and approach to problems has grown tremendously, and for that I can only say thank you. Amazing teamwork. Raphael Barbo 

From Matt - I really enjoyed working with Dan on our final group project for Module 2.  His experience working with others shows right away.  He is a natural at focusing on what needs to be done and keeping on track in agile development.  I can see from his work style that he has led many teams and knows how to work well with any team member.  I respected Dan’s ability to think outside the box and recommend creative ideas for the project that would make it better.  He is dedicated to becoming a great programmer and his previous business and technical experience make him an asset to any team.

### Playing a Part

I did pairing sessions with Mod 1 students during the first weeks of the mod.  I found it to be both challenging and rewarding, guiding students was more difficult than I anticipated.  I also attended Denver Beta, a showcase for startups in the area, with another Mod 2 frontend student in my posse.

In my posse, Bezos, I played an active role.  I led one of our weekly discussions and provided material for the group to learn more about progressive web apps.  I also opened up my personal project for other students to help me with.  I am working on building a web app for group photo sharing and it was awesome to collaborate with other students, especially those from the front-end program and get their perspectives.
