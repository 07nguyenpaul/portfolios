# Dan Broadbent - M2 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module is to build on the fountaions of Ruby and TDD that I learned in mod 1, and be able to bring these skills to the web with Rails.  I want to get very comfortable with the MVC model so that I will be able to learn different frameworks that use it.  I'm very interested in learning SQL, databases, and database relationships.  I also want to participate in the Turing community more than I did last module.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)
Evaluator: Casey

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

* 4: Developer independently breaks complex processes into logical sequences of small steps and validates progress along the way

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement more than one solution in Ruby through refactoring

3. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs occasional guidance

4. MVC & Rails Style

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

5. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development with guidance

6. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback throughout the process

Notes: Work on collaboration, I do a lot of processing in my head, so be sure to talk through what I'm doing out loud.


## B: Individual Work & Projects

The individual work this module mainly consisted of working through different tutorials in order to learn the basic conventions of Ruby on Rails.  The only individual project where we had some freedom to work on things in our own way was Rails Mini-Project.

#### Rails Mini-Project

* [Idea Box GitHub](https://github.com/danbroadbent/idea_box)
* [Rails Mini-Project Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

Idea Box is an app to record your ideas.  It allows users to create ideas and save them with a description to different categories.  This project was not formally evaluated, but the learning goals included test driven development of a rails app with feature tests, setting up CRUD functionality, using 1-to-1 and 1-to-many database realationships, using RESTful routes, and implementing authentication of users.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Group projects were the highlight of this module.  I worked on two teams of three, and they both worked together very well.  In Rush Hour we build a Sinatra app, and Little Shops was built with Ruby on Rails.

#### Rush Hour

* [](Rush Hour GitHub)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md](Rush Hout Original Assignment)

Rush Hour was a web app built with Ruby, Sinatra, and Active Record.  It is a tool that aggregates and analyzes visitor data from another website.  Customer data was a payload in the form of a JSON object that we had to accept and anaylize.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

This was a very eye-opening session.  The idea that many jobs in the tech world are never even posted is really important to how you go about the job hunt.  Knowing what companies you are interested in and what kind of cultures they have is very important.  This gives you a way to start persuing those companies and finding common interests with people who already work there.

#### Networking with Lia

This session offered a lot of great strageies to be successful at networking and not see it as a chore.  

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

Since we had a couple of serious group projects this module, it was very helpful that the whole class went over communication strategies.  I found the most important and useful strategy that we went over was making your feedback objective and free of emotion, judgement, and assumptions.  This is beneficial for both the giver and reciever of the feedback as it keeps it from being taken in the wrong way and much more comfortable to give and accept.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

I did pairing sessions with Mod 1 students during the first weeks of the mod.  I found it to be both challenging and rewarding, guiding students was more difficult than I anticipated.  I also attended Denver Beta, a showcase for startups in the area, with another Mod 2 frontend student in my posse.

In my posse, Bezos, I played an active role.  I led one of our weekly discussions and provided material for the group to learn more about progressive web apps.  I also opened up my personal project for other students to help me with.  I am working on building a web app for group photo sharing and it was awesome to collaborate with other students, especially those from the front-end program and get their perspectives.
