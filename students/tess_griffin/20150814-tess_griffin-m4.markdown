# Tess Griffin - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I was looking to improve my TDD chops because I felt that in M3 those were lacking. I also wanted to gain more confidence in all areas of JavaScript including JavaScript testing.

This was a 7 day project where you had a take a previous student's pivot, add a million records and to fix up the performance. I was in Ottawa for the Shopify interviews during the assessment. I gave myself scores based on what I have. I did not do the load script because I felt that with the time I had to work on the project with the interview, that time would be better spent on fixing performance issues.
