# Tom Leskin - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt weak on JavaScript. I used Exercism a couple times a week, read a few chapters of "Eloquent JavaScript" book, and tried to apply these concepts in my individual and team projects. In the end I feel much more comfortable with JavaScript. I felt at a disadvantage going into the job hunt compared to others in my cohort so I've been trying to spend more time working on my Ruby fundamentals and problem solving. I spent time working through some algorithms and data structures to accomplish this.
