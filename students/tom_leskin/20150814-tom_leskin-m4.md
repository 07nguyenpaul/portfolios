# Tom Leskin - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt weak on JavaScript. I used Exercism three times per week, read the "Eloquent JavaScript" book, and tried to apply these concepts in my individual and team projects. In the end I feel much more comfortable with JavaScript.

### End of Module Assessment

* [Original Assignment](http://github.com/turingschool/challenges/robodoku.markdown)

In this week-long project I built a sudoku-solving machine. It was
evaluated by Steve with the following results:

"Good object decomposition, but it only solves the easiest of puzzles."

* Ruby Syntax: 3

### Feedback to Me

In the previous module feedback from my peers encouraged me to ask for help
more frequently rather than get stuck and stay there. This module I set a timer
when I ran into a problem and, if I got to 20 minutes without progress, I'd ask
for help. My feedback this module showed improvement and teammates said I'm a
better collaborator.
