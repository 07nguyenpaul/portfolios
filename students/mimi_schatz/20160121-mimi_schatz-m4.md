# Mimi Schatz - Module: 4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

My goal this module was to stay motivated and focused despite the pressure to find a job. I was excited to learn a new language and hoped to find a hidden love for frontend development. I don't think that happened, but I discovered that it is a lot easier to learn a second language than it was to learn the first. I have learned a ton over the course of the last seven months and it still surprises me that I'm here at the end!
