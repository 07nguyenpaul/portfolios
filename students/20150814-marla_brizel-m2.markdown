# Marla Brizel - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, my main goal was to begin laying a foundation of knowledge for building robust web applications, while continuing to expand upon my Ruby knowledge.

### End of Module Assessment

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time, with the exception of an excused half-day absence on July 24. I had a doctor's appointment that morning because I had been sick for over a month and wasn't getting better.

### Work

#### Personal Website

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/personal)
* [Website](http://www.marlabrizel.com)

In this project, I built a personal website from scratch using HTML and CSS. I connected this website to a custom domain and linked it to my Jekyll blog.

#### Doggy Daycare

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/doggy_daycare)
* [Heroku](https://dog-e-daycare.herokuapp.com)

This is an ongoing "breakable toy" sort of project. Its purpose is to reinforce basic Rails concepts covered in class in one cohesive project. I used it mainly as a place to do homework assignments for a second time after first completing the assignments as outlined. I also used it to practice deploying to Heroku.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following group projects:

#### Traffic Spy
In this week-long project, I with two other teammates built an analytics
platform for website traffic. We focused on understanding HTTP requests, got an introduction to JSON, and worked on PostgreSQL-flavored ActiveRecord queries. I particularly enjoyed the chance to practice ActiveRecord as well as refactor code.

* [GitHub URl](https://github.com/applegrain/traffic-spy)
Evaluator: Rachel
Scores:
* Functional Expectations: 3.5
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Components: 3.5
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 4
* View Layer: 3.5

We received compliments from Rachel, who told us during the evaluation that it was one of the cleanest Traffic Spy implementations she had ever seen.

#### Little Shop of Orders (FKA Dinner Dash)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marlabrizel/jurassic_parka)
* [Heroku](https://jurassic-parka.herokuapp.com)

In this two-week project, my group implemented Jurassic Parka, an e-commerce
site. My main areas of focus included implementing a shopping cart using
POROs, custom controller actions, and complex views.

### Feedback to Me

* **Lovisa Svallingson**, Traffic Spy teammate: "I really enjoyed working with you because you made it easy to be very direct with you. We could be very direct with each other in terms of expectations, what needed to be done and we discussed like adults when we had differing opinions on whatever. And you were good knowing when you could let us wear the project management hat and when it was good for you to step in and lead."

## Community
