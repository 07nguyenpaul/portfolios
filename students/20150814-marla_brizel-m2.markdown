# Marla Brizel - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, my main goal was to begin laying a foundation for building robust
web applications, while continuing to expand upon my Ruby knowledge.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time, with the exception of the
morning of July 24. I had a doctor's appointment that morning to figure out why
I've been sick since the middle of Module 1.

### Work

TODO

#### Personal Website

* [GitHub URL](TODO)

In this project, I built a personal website from scratch using HTML and CSS. I
connected this website to a custom domain and linked it to my Jekyll blog.

#### Doggy Daycare

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jcasimir/robodoku)
* [Original
  Assignment](http://github.com/turingschool/challenges/robodoku.markdown)

  This is an ongoing "breakable toy" sort of project. Its purpose is to
  reinforce basic Rails concepts covered in class in one cohesive project. I
  used it mainly as a place to do homework assignments for a second time after
  first completing the assignments as outlined. I also used it to practice
  deploying to Heroku.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following group projects:

#### Traffic Spy
In this week-long project, I with two other teammates built an analytics
platform for website traffic. We focused on understanding HTTP requests, got
an introduction to JSON, and worked on PostgreSQL-flavored ActiveRecord
queries. I particularly enjoyed the chance to practice ActiveRecord as well as
refactor code.

repository: https://github.com/applegrain/traffic-spy
Evaluator: Rachel
Scores:
* Functional Expectations: 3.5
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Components: 3.5
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 4
* View Layer: 3.5

We received compliments from Rachel, who told us during the evaluation that it
was one of the cleanest Traffic Spy implementations she had ever seen.

#### Little Shop of Orders (FKA Dinner Dash)
In this two-week project, my group implemented Jurassic Parka, an e-commerce
site. My main areas of focus included implementing a shopping cart using
POROs, custom controller actions, and complex views.
