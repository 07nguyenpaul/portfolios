# Jamie Kawahara - Module 3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into the module I felt very shy and isolated.  This module, I offered
to help module 1 students and also taught a student led session.  I feel like
I've made some friends and helped people feel more creative at Turing.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exceptions of:
Friday, July 24th (dental work)
Friday, July 31st (friend visiting from out-of-state)
Friday, August 7th (dental work)

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Self-Directed Project: 3D Spark!

3D Spark is a website that brings the best of Thingiverse to novice 3D printers.
It allows users to login with Twitter, browse through 3D designs and select what
they want to print easily.  3D Spark is an image-centric website which focuses on
the distilling the information from Thingiverse into a more simple easy-to-use format.
