# Dmitry Vizersky - Module 3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
This module I set out to be more invloved within my posse
and within any group I happened to be apart of. I planned to
be ready for morning challenges at 8:20am. I also wanted to try
to solve as many morning challenges as I can in JavaScript instead of Ruby.

We started with an existing single-tenant application from 1505's dinner-dash and built CodeStarter.
CodeStarter is a multi-tenant web-application for software companies to present their
dream projects and solicit needed funding from registered users.

(feedback to me)
I had a really great experience working with you. It's obvious how much you care about making beautiful products. I felt intimidated by the front end before this project but I don't feel that way anymore and it's because you took time to show me a lot about Bootstrap.

Like you mentioned, we both have strong personalities so sometimes it was tough to come to an agreement on how to approach a problem. On the positive side, it was awesome that our disagreements were always productive and civil and based in fact. We did have to undo some design choices after the fact, and I think a lot of the annoyance and pain of that could have been mitigated by having design discussions as a team before implementation. It felt difficult to gain your trust at the beginning of the project but this went away quickly and I think we had a great dynamic during the project.

If given a choice on a future project, I'd pick you again as a teammate. I will definitely be coming to you with front-end questions on my personal project too. I think you are already having a positive impact on our cohort and I'm glad you're here.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)
I filled out every single survey and tried to give constructive feedback.
Marla and Lovisa were my teamates for the pivot.
I submitted earnest detailed feedback for both of them.
