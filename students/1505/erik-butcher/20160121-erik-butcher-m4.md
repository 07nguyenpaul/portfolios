# Erik Butcher - M4 2nd Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Previous modules have highlighted an inconsistent reliability; extra measures were taken to deliver things well and on time. I've improved in this area, but I struggled with it occasionally, and I will continue to improve it.

Whenever possible, I took different approaches to assignments than I had before in order to keep me engaged and broaden my skillset.

### Homework

Discover Dev Tools 5/5
Sorting Algorithms 3/3
Writing Testable JS 3/3
Mary Rose Cook livecoding 3/3
Recursive Countdown 10/10
Fibonacci JS 10/10
Factorial Generator 10/10

Refactor Tractor JS 25/25
Dangerous Denver JS 15/15
Dangerous Denver Ruby 10/10
Websockets Workshop 30/30
Mini ScaleUp 25/25
Extracism +15

Total 250/235 (106.55%)

Most of these were not anything new but were a useful refresher. MiniScaleUp was an exception, since I horribly mismanaged the full-size ScaleUp last time; while it isn't likely to have the performance a full ScaleUp would, seeing it in steps will help immensely with future performance concerns on anything I write.

"Extracism" are extra points awarded for doing several exercisms and writing up some findings on my own and others' approaches to the problems.

Another stab at the IdeaBox project. Inline editing was a mystifing dream I had no idea how to attempt the previous go-round at this, and being able to get a sort-of-working version of it was a huge success for me.

My previous GameTime, Switchblock, was very much rooted in state. In order to take the project in a different direction, I decided, with agreement from partner Dave, to go in a direction where nothing is not changing during play. Dave and I worked together very well, and got this out that works at least okay.

#### RealTime: Bookmeet
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/with-a-k/bookmeet)
* [Production URL](https://bookmeet.herokuapp.com)

Concept and Features 50/100
Code Quality 10/30
Client-Side 25/30
Testing 0/30
Interface 4/5
Workflow 2/5

Total 91/200 (45.5%)

RealTime accompanied a trouble spot in my self-discipline and deliverability. As I chose to do the Personal Time variant of the project, I struggled a little more with data storage and Express views with Jade, leading to rushing through large swaths of later features and not thinking about things. I had no idea where to even begin with test-writing and should definitely have asked.

tl;dr The app works fine, but it's missing features that were expected, was untested except by hand, and is kind of hacky in places.

### Simulated Assessment: Thoughtbox
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/with-a-k/thoughtbox-exam)
* (Not in production)
* [Assessment Details and Rubric](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/82831c5b25029415ce8b)

Total 60/100 (60%)

I struggled not with the technical aspects of this but with my own motivation to do it, as it was exactly the previous end of module assessment. I did not buckle down and just do it again immediately anyway, which lead to using time on it I probably should have been spending on RealTime. Clearly not my finest moment.

### End of Module Assessment

A good project. Meeka, who evaluated, said that this is along the lines of what she wanted to see from my RealTime, and noted that this level of focus is where I should be all the time.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time.

### Feedback to Me

"Erik’s understanding of how code works is remarkable. At any time during our Game Time project, I knew I could go to him for help working through difficult parts of the logic. He was responsible for getting the tomatoes to go in random directions, which was giving me trouble when I tried to implement that feature. When crunch time comes, and something needs to get done, Erik is able to rise to the challenge." - Dave Maurer, on GameTime

"I don’t think it’s something of which you’re unaware, but sometimes we need to hear things repeatedly to encourage us to take action.

It’s too often that I see you not paying attention to what’s happening in class or during some event (lightning talks, guest speakers, etc). It’s not that I particularly care about you paying attention to me or others for my own benefit, but I’ve also seen you struggle with projects or just not produce something I think you feel good about. For your benefit, I would like to see you push harder to accept that things which you might not appreciate at first can be valuable if you push through the frustration of feeling like you’re wasting time.
I know you’re aware of your issues in a social environment, so Turing can’t be an easy place for you. I’ve struggled in a different, but sometimes similar, way my whole life. So much so, in fact, that I was put on a Performance Improvement Plan while at Turing because I said and did things that made people uncomfortable. I can tell you that there’s a lot about the PIP process that I disagreed with, including the directive that I review materials online intended to teach me about not being an asshole. That said, I reviewed the materials, and as insulted as I felt doing it (and as much as I hate to admit to Jeff), the truth is that I’m better for having done it. To be clear, I’m saying that there’s value in doing things you don’t necessarily like doing, and I’m not exaggerating when I say that Turing (through Jeff’s influence) is the first environment I’ve been in where I truly believe the one(s) in a position of authority have my best interests at heart. I think about how much easier it would have been in another program where we wouldn’t have had to deal with gear-up sessions, lightning talks, or portfolio reviews, but every one of those things is a piece in the puzzle that makes us better people, and that’s what we need to be successful in this industry.
I really wish the best for you, and I hope you’re able to continue pushing through some of the unique difficulties you face. Like I said, I struggle with some similar issues, and I’d be happy to talk with you one-on-one about it if you’re ever so inclined." - Alon Waisman

In response to the question 'Do I have any weak points that I should improve on? What are they?':

"I have noticed that your focus switches off and then you get sidetracked by other things for long stretches of time. I have difficulties with this myself. Something that has worked for me is instead of setting regular time intervals to take breaks, but to set goals based upon my work load with set "rewards" each time I reach a goal. Like hey, if I build all the edit functionality for the comments, then I can play one game of League of Legends!" - Anon 1

"Being engaged with people, in person. Things that would help with this: Stop wearing headphones all of the time.
Stop playing games all of the time.

If you don't really like interacting with people, it's gonna be tough, but try your best to learn to like it. It will do you tons of good." - Anon 2

In response to the question 'Do I have any good strengths that I should keep? What are they?':

"Not afraid to ask for help." - Anon 1

"You have good ideas and solutions. I have seen you help others and you can be quite insightful. You have always been pleasant and respectful to talk to, despite your admission of having difficulty establishing repore (sic) with peers. You have a mischievous sense of humor that comes out every once in a while." - Anon 2

In response to the question 'What good and bad experiences have you had working with me?':

"Bad: Had a paring assignment, and you put your headphones in and I did it alone." - Anon 1

In response to the question 'Are there any specific qualities you think I should try to find in jobs I apply for?':

"Whoever is mentoring you should be a strong leader. Someone you respect and someone who will help you grow." - Anon 1

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I struggle to give feedback to people, because I don't like judging people, and I feel like feedback is judging.

"Dave has an insuppressible energy and doesn’t let setbacks get him down; he knows how to celebrate small victories and not take it overboard. He can be a rock for support no matter what difficulty you face." -> to Dave Maurer, GameTime partner

"As much trouble as I’ve been giving you about poking everyone about Student Advisory Board surveys, it’s that kind of thing I feel like I need more of - I have issues with distraction, and that persistence in making sure people do things is a huge asset when dealing with people like that." -> to Travis Haby

"I had no idea you were ever on a PIP for… ‘being an asshole’, as you put it, since you’ve shown that you’re very thoughtful. I can’t say whether this was always you or whether it’s a dramatic change, but that’s a very good quality. That said, I skew shy and believing that people aren’t my friends even if they say so, so I was a little off-put by how let’s-do-this you were for… I forget what it was." -> to Alon Waisman

### Playing a Part

On 12-18, I gave a lightning talk on validation techniques in Rails.
I continued attending improv. I also attended January's Denver.rb and Denver Swift Heads (the latter of which I called attention to during wrap-up a couple days before, owing to Jeff publicizing it in Slack).
