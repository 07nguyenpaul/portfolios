## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission for Module 3 is to focus on getting better at Ruby on Rails. I have
struggled with wanting to learn different things and spreading myself too thin.
I am going to focus on the curriculum, and minimize distractions trying to learn
other things like Elixir on Phoenix, Swift, etc. I will also continue to be a
part of the local tech community by participating in Meetups and other events
whenever possible.

### Work

I completed the following individual projects this module:

#### API Curious (YouTwitFace)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/you_twit_face)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md)

In this project, I focused on consuming and working with data from public APIs.
I worked with the OAuth protocol (OmniAuth gem) for Twitter, and created a
limited-functionality Twitter clone.

Completion: 4: Developer delivered all planned features plus 2 extensions.
Organization: 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their
progress in real-time.
Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%),
tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external services.
Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
User Experience: 3: The application covers many interactions of the target
application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

#### Rales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/rales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rales_engine.md)

In this project, I used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposed
the SalesEngine data schema.

Completion: 2.5 - Code was good and well refactored. Overall good project but 4
failures 2 errors.
Test-Driven Development: 4
Code Quality: 3
API Design: 4
Queries: 2

#### Self-Directed Project (Walk This Way)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/walk_this_way)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

In this project, I mashed up the Yelp, Walk Score, and Google Maps APIs to
create a pedestrian-centric business directory.

Completion: 3 - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by
the client.
Organization: 3 - Developer used a project management tool to keep
their project organized.
Test-Driven Development: 4 - Project shows exceptional use of testing at
different layers (above 95% coverage).
Code Quality: 3 - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
User Experience: 3 - Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
Performance: 3 - Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

## Team

### Projects

I completed the following team projects this module:

#### The Pivot (The Ocho Tickets)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

In this project, we built upon an existing implementation of Little Shop of
Orders. We transformed a carnivorous plant ordering site into a platform that
handled multiple, simultaneous businesses. Each business had its own name,
unique URL pattern, items, orders, and administrators.

Completion: 4: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the
client in a timely manner.
Organization: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress
in real-time.
Test-Driven Development: 3: Project shows exceptional use of testing at
different layers (above 95% coverage). A couple of gaps were found.
Code Quality: 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
User Experience: 4: Project exhibits a production-ready and polished UX.

"Sam is a very strong developer. It was a pleasure to be on his team for the
pivot. Not only was he easy to work with but he was always available to answer
any questions that I had. I feel that I learned a lot just from being in his
group. I would really enjoy working with him again in the future."
- David Shim

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I submitted written feedback to David Shim, Michael Dorrance, and Lovisa
Svallingson.

### Being a Community Member

I participated in Meetups including Code for Denver, Denver.rb, Boulder Ruby,
and DenverScript. I participated in the Hack the Arts Hackfest. I volunteered to
help out with Denver Startup Week.

"Sam is a real asset to our cohort because of his experience and calm approach
to looking for a solution. He is always willing to help with a question and
explain it so that you understand it. He is a great guy who is a team player and
always brings a positive attitude."
- Michael Dorrance

### Playing a Part

On Wednesday, August 19, I organized a Denver Cruiser Ride social event.
On Friday, October 2, I delivered a lightning talk "O Arel, WHERE Art Thou? SQL
Querying with Arel"
I did little things at Turing like clean up, buy coffee, and make sure rooms
were locked up at night.
