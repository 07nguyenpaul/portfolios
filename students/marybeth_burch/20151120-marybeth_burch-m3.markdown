# Mary Beth Burch - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

I will continue to be intentional about bringing a positive attitude and a growth mindset each day. I will get better at embracing road blocks and work on my tenacity and creativity when it comes to working through challenges, but I will ask for help from mentors and others before I get to the point of beating my head against a wall. I think I get better at this each module. I will do my best to look outside of myself every day and notice others who might need support or encouragement. I will try not to compare myself to others and work on making myself the best programmer I can be. I will begin to actively explore where I hope to land after Turing, and look for other people and organizations that are combining technology with other issues and fields that I care about. I will not eat junk food just because it is on the table. I will try my best to learn something new (Javascript, etc.).

## Community

### Playing a Part

* I volunteered to help host the Women Who Code Ruby study group.
* Kids Who Code
* Young entrepreneurs
* Clothing Swap? Bike work day?
* Reaching out to new people and offering support.
* I pick up after others, run the dishwasher, and do some cleanup almost every day. I make lots of coffee and taught new people how to make it, too.
* I'm present for warm-up every day and actively contribute. I've started trying to organize a posse gathering outside of school with mentors and have a little interest, but need to follow through.
