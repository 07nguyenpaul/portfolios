## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I started this module with little experience, outside of Pragmatic Studios (I took my time completing the whole thing, and found myself referencing it often) and some CodeAcademy and Treehouse work. It is amazing to me how I can feel like I've learned so much in six weeks, but still feel like I am just getting started. This module, I feel that one of my strengths was persevering through challenges and not seeking help too soon. I feel like I found a good balance of contributing and learning from others in the team projects of which I was a part. Next module, one of my goals is to work more with mentors. I think this would have helped me move forward faster on some of my individual projects this module. It was challenging to strike a balance between too much and too little support.

### End of Module Assessment

I was first assessed by Mike Dao, and did not pass the assessment. I was too nervous during the test to remember what I knew, and I kept mixing up FileIO and CSV's. After spending a little too much time feeling bad about how I did, myself and a few others who had to re-assess took some time to study together and share our ideas. I reassessed with Josh Cheek and felt much more confident. Below are my scores and feedback from Josh for my Scrabble challenge on highest scoring word:

"Nice initial anticipation of enumerable methods, and good extrapolation of 'max_by' to handle the rest of the problem."

"Good job explaining what you're thinking, and good analysis of the problem."

* Ruby Syntax and API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 4
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 3+
* Collaboration: 4

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an absence on Friday, August 14th for a family commitment scheduled prior to my acceptance at Turing.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

In this project, I created a parser to convert markdown into HTML. This project was my first exposure to using markdown. It was also my first experience using File IO, and I feel like it gave me a solid base for the rest of our Module 1 projects. My project was evaluated by Jeff with the following results:

"Good small components"
"Good happy-path tests, need to define the edges a bit more"
"Like that you iterated on the implementation"
"Overall good progress!"

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Linked Lists

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/linked-lists)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

In this project, I wrote an implementation of a linked list that could perform a variety of functions such as appending, prepending, and searching by index and value.

"Good tests and some attention to the edge cases"
"Implementation looks solid"
"Some good reuse of functionality"

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping / Recursion: 3

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/EnigmaPlus)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

My partner and I worked together to create a program that would encrypt and decrypt messages based on different rotations determined by generated keys and offsets. For the most part, we collaborated well. Sometimes I felt it was hard for me to get my ideas heard. This helped me go into my next project with some goals around sharing air time and making sure I was being a respectful listener. We received the following feedback and scores on Enigma:

"some successes, some struggles -- encrypt and decrypt work pretty well, and would both like to spend more time refactoring, share functionality, reduce
duplication"
"struggled through File I/O but eventually got it figured out"
"implementation has lots of good parts but some gaps in clarity, maybe helped
with a little rethinking of variable/method names and how the words become paragraphs"

* Functionality: 2
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

My partner said: "The highlight of pairing with MB was seeing each of our ideas succeed at different points in the project. Many times it felt this project would have gone faster if it was a solo assignment but I was reminded of the benefits of pair programming during those times when her ideas worked and mine would've held us back. I feel we both learned a lot about effective communication during pairing, especially during a stressful project. I would enjoy working with MB again at some point in the future and I hope she feels the same!"


#### Sales Engine

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine.markdown)

My partner and I created a data reporting tool and built numerous relationships between different data files. This project was timed perfectly for me, as I'd been struggling with FileIO, and this helped me to build confidence with those skills. We received the following feedback and scores on Sales Engine:

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I'm looking forward to getting a feedback app set up in the near future. I think I was able to provide my partners on bigger projects with meaningful feedback that was both positive and useful. In Enigma, my partner and I were having issues hearing each others' ideas and I was able to address this and help us figure out more effective communication. I'm not one to shy away from giving and receiving honest feedback, and I'd like to help our cohort think about how we can make this happen in an authentic way for each other. I found it hard to remember to take the time for feedback with someone who I may have just been working with for an hour or so, and I think having an organized fashion in which to do this will be helpful.

My peers said:
* "MB is extremely dedicated which is an inspiration. She is also pleasant to work with, proceeding in a steady manner. She doesn't hesitate to ask questions, using the resources the team has to offer."

* "I didn’t get the opportunity to pair with you so I can’t give you technical feedback.  But it meant a lot to mean when I was feeling emotional about my enigma project and my partner and you listened to me and were supportive."

### Playing a Part

* I joined the outreach Slack channel, but haven't felt confident enough in my skills to step up yet. I look forward to doing outreach in Module 2, and have spoken with some teacher friends about the possibility of working with their middle school students.

* On Linked Lists and Enigma, I spent time working with a cohort member who was having difficulty understanding parts of the project. I also put my work aside when she was upset and needed someone to talk to.

* I am enjoying my time on student advisory board each Thursday, although I would like to find a better way to solicit more feedback from my cohort so I have more to share.

* I reminded my posse when it was our cleanup week and I also have pitched in a few mornings and evenings to put away dishes or load the dishwasher.
