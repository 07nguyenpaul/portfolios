###Areas of Emphasis
My dad has been in the hospital for much of this module. His wife is making it
almost impossible for any family to visit him. My daughter came forward with
reports of sexual abuse that happened at after school care. I am having
flashbacks of years ago when my other daughter suffered even worse. Some might
use these as reasons to take a break this module. Instead, it has reaffirmed my
reasons for being here. I am building myself into a position where I can have greater
effect with the help I provide. I am strengthening myself in order to better combat
the obstacles of life.  

With all that is going on, I am stretched quite thin. I feel stressed and ragged,
and messed up my last project by not spending enough time on it.

Now... the good stuff. My determination was tested, but man, I feel good about my
accomplishments here. Besides the Real Time application, I rocked my projects. I
lost track of how many high-fives, fist-bumps, etc. Holzman and I shared while
making chess. Kids Who Code finished up the first iteration strong, sharing their
awesome apps with students here. Next iteration starts Saturday January 30th! We
will be taking their development skills to the mobile platform! I am starting to
hear back from companies and feel like a strong candidate. Most of all, I enjoy
the creative and problem solving aspects of programming. Instead of feeling like
I was stagnating at my military and blue-collar jobs, I feel like I am challenged
and growing.

Thank you.

148/150 points (no extensions attempted)

Personal note: I finished this before midnight before the day it was due!

###Thoughtbox
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/thought_box)

Assessed By: Lovisa

90/100 points

Personal note: This project reminded me that I am slower at coding than most of
my peers. In order to continually put out strong scores, I have invested much more
time into each of my projects.

###RealTime
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/schedule_me)

Assessed By: Steve

83/200 points

Personal note: With all that was going on, I did not give myself enough time to
succeed at this project.

###Homework
100%

###Final

###Attendance
I skipped coming in two days that were made into all day work days on solo projects.
No tardies.


Team
--------------------------------------
###Projects
I worked on just one team project this block:

###Chess
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jphoenix86/chess_trainer)

Assessed By: Lovisa

Notes: Wow

325/300 points

Personal note: We knew it was going to be a challenge when Steve advised against
building such a challenging game, "Just the logic behind Checkmate alone...", but
we set ambitious, yet overall attainable goals at each checkpoint and worked many
long, but rewarding hours to have a clean, complete chess game.    


Community
-------------------------------------

###Giving Feedback

I usually take more time on the feedback forms than is allotted because I try to put
forth real feedback. This is mostly due to me feeling like Turing actually puts
this solicited feedback to use. I have filled out each form asked of me that I am
aware of.  

###Playing a Part

* http://turingwithgeorge.tumblr.com is still ongoing. I notice that my posts are
  becoming increasingly technical. I still have fun with it though and have many
  blog posts planned for the break! I feel my blog is a useful tool for myself as
  it forces me to go back through my notes and further research topics I am unclear
  on so that I can write about it more effectively. Over 100 posts!

* Kids Who Code is still going strong. Demo night went great! This meetup will
  continue after I graduate. It is highly rewarding. The kids are enthusiastically
  learning STEM. Shirts incomming! Thank you!
