###Areas of Emphasis
Being invited by Jeff to join Turing was flattering. I did a lot to prepare for this and make sure my personal life was in order. Despite this, I had this nagging worry that the reason I didn't get everything I needed to out of gSchool was that I just wasn't smart enough anymore and the personal issues I had were only a secondary detractor. Instead of giving in to that feeling, I am rebelling against it. I have been working hard to stay on top of the material so that I don't feel left behind. I also try to make myself available to answer questions and many people, including Bret Doucette, Adam Jensen, Nicole Hall, and both Justins (Pease and Holzman) have brought questions to me. Explaining programming and workflow concepts and helping to guide them in general, reinforces my understanding of the material we are covering. Based upon the feedback I have received from them, I believe I am doing a fair job of it. I am happy here.

###End of Module 1 Assessment

nil

###Attendance
I have attended class every day. While apartment hunting has cut into my afternoons, I still have managed to stay late occasionally for study sessions, DSA, and generally make myself available for collaboration.

###Work
Here is a list of the solo projects I have completed this module.

####Robodoku
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/robodoku)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/robodoku.markdown)

I don't have the link for this assessment completed by Mike Dao (it isn't in the 1507 ruby submissions markdown yet). Here is what I remember of his critique.
My logic worked and solved simple and the next step up from simple, but not quite medium difficulty sudoku puzzles. My ruby style and separation of responsibilities was excellent. My tests had good coverage, but could test for edge cases. My enumerables were used effectively, but there is room for improvement.

* Functionality: 3
* Ruby Style: 4
* Encapsulation: 4
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Enumerables: 3

personal note: this was a difficult one to conceptualize and it took me a while to get the basic logic. Once I did that though, I took time to refactor and try to make what I was doing very clear so that it would be easy to build upon, given more time. I felt very successful in learning what I set out to learn with this project.

####Binary Search Tree
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/binary_search_tree)
* [Original Assignment]()

Assessed By: Mike Dao
Assessment Notes:

Works.
Pretty well tested
Two extensions
Some long methods, some opportunities to refactor some intense logic.
Score:

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Enumerable and Collections: 3

personal note: since I didn't get through all the logic on the last project, my goal was to complete all the logic on this one (including the extensions). I did some refactoring, but it was not my focus. I also felt I met my learning goals with this project.

####Enigma
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/enigma)
* [Original Assignment]()

Assessed by: Mike Dao

36 tests 94.91% coverage (only my command line interface code was untested)
good full integrations tests
cracker words without brute force, cracks nearly instantly
some opportunities for refactoring, overall good code, great separation of responsibilities

* Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3.5
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4

 personal note: Though a challenge, I liked this project (as many of my classmates seemed to as well). I thought I was scheduling my time well and was ahead of the goals I set for myself. The last part though took up much more time than I allotted for and I ended up working long hours to complete it. I wanted to combine my logic skills from Binary Search Tree and the encapsulization and style from Robodoku in one project. Given my scores, I felt I succeeded and feel I could have done even better with just a bit more time (but who can't?).
