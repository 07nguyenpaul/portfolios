Personal note: I did not want to take my great scores from Module 1 and get complacent. I have tried many things in order to keep my own motivation up to keep pushing myself.

###Attendance
I have attended class every day.

###Work
Here is a list of the solo projects I have worked on this module.

####Blackheart
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/blackheart)

This is a project I hope to implement over my time at Turing. It has been something I keep *intending* to make, but never dedicate enough time to. I use different branches to explore topics we cover in class as well as my own personal online/mentor inquiries. If I like those branches, I merge them into master. It is not graded. I use it just for a fun way to continue practicing my Rails.

####Arbitrary Point Assigner Box
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/point_box)

Feedback to Me

Community
-------------------------------------

###Giving Feedback

I actively sought to give feedback to Rolen Le, the mentor who worked with me the most. I also gave feedback (almost all positive) to Mitch Ashby and Andrew Carmer.

I wrote feedback for Mimi Schatz and Rose Kohn for their portfolios.

In addition to the written feedback I was asked to give about Russell Harms, my partner for the SalesEngine project, I also spoke with him in person, giving him detailed feedback and asking for feedback in return from him.

###Playing a Part

* On Thursday, July 9th, I led a basic Rails code-along to help reinforce CRUD and MVC 
* On Thursday, July 16th, I set up a Robodoku workshop with Alon Waisman going into detail about the logic therein.
* I started teaching my daughters the basics of Ruby and programming in general through the use of Scratch (thanks Mike Dao) and Ruby Warrior.
* I still have an ongoing blog, http://turingwithgeorge.tumblr.com that gets regular updates. I have well over 50 blog posts now (all relating to my time here at Turing or coding in general)
* I gave regular shout outs on twitter (@georgehudson78) to fellow classmates, prior gSchool classmates (many now Turing mentors), guest speakers, and instructors.
