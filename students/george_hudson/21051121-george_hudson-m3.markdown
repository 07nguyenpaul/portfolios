George Hudson - M3 Portfolio
============================


Individual
----------------------------
###Areas of Emphasis
This was a tough module for me. I felt the depression I have suffered creeping
back in. This is probably due to me testing my personal boundaries as to how much
extra I could take on while still doing well in class and in my projects. I knew I
would be pushing myself by adding in regular teaching sessions on Fridays to learn
and teach Swift on top of stepping up my responsibilities for Kids Who Code meetup.

Next module I plan to take one step back. I still would like to lead Kids Who
Code, but would like to organize it to the point where someone from an earlier class
can take over the reins when I have completed the program. Depending on the situation,
however, I might like to stay involved. It has been a highly rewarding experience.
I do not plan to teach regular Friday student led sessions though.


###End of Module 2 Assessment

Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

Notes: George worked quickly and knew almost everything we went through before I
  had to   explain anything. When we conversed about something that we were unsure about he collaborated well and got things quickly.

  Although we ran out of time to really push logic down the stack he said early that he wanted to try to do it which showed me he was aware of the concept. I was overall really impressed with George's rails knowledge and comfortability with doing everything.

Scores:
* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 4
* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
* Rails Syntax & API: 3
* Rails Style: 3
* Testing: 3
* Collaboration: 4

Personal note:

###ApiCurious
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/LitHub)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

Assessed By: Josh Mejia

Notes:

Scores:
* Features: 2
* Interface: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Server-Side Application and APIs: 3

Personal note: While Josh was using the wrong rubric for most of us and so didn't
evaluate our use of project organization, I feel I would have scored strongly here.
I had a robust tracking system on Waffle.io where I broke down chores, stories,
and enhancements that were updated in real time. I dove down some deep rabbit holes
on this project, leading me to not finish the requirements, yet having a better
understanding of OOP and the stateless nature of HTTP especially. I chose to not
have any database whatsoever for this project to see if I could make it viable
without one. All the features worked as I expected and I would have been able to
finish the objectives without a database without complications with just a bit more
time. It was a challenge to persist the data I wanted without use of a database.

###RailsEngine

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1507/11-rails_engine.markdown)

Assessed By: Jorge Tellez

Notes:

Scores:
* Completion: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 3.5
* API Design: 4
* Queries: 4:

Personal note: This project kicked my ass. So have all the Sales Engines and their
iterations! While I did much better score wise and ApiCurious, I am not as proud of
it. This project really let me feel how slow I am compared to many of my classmates.
I did not have my features complete until 5am the day it was due. This was not due
to slacking off earlier. I set midnight bedtimes for myself on the other nights. I
stayed up all night the last night because I wanted better scores than my last.
There were many times where I felt like giving up. I still don't understand all
of what I implemented.

###Attendance
No absences. On time. EVERY time. 

###Just For Fun

####Blackheart
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Egogre/blackheart)

This is a project I hope to implement over my time at Turing. It has been something I keep *intending* to make, but never dedicate enough time to. I use different branches to explore topics we cover in class as well as my own personal online/mentor inquiries. If I like those branches, I merge them into master. It is not graded. I use it just for a fun way to continue practicing my Rails. I restarted this from scratch recently
to see how long it would take me to build up to the point I had got to and was almost
disappointed with how little it felt like I had accomplished before!


Team
--------------------------------------
###Projects
I worked on two team projects this block:

####The Pivot
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ChrisCenatie/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

Assessed by: Josh Mejia

Assessment notes:

* 155 tests with Great test coverage. Only 1 line not tested and it was a call to Twilio.
* Nice use of POROs.
* Controllers were really clean
* Twilio integration
* Some nice use of jQuery

Scores:

* Completion: 3
* Organization: 3
* Progress: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 3
* User Experience: 3

personal note: We mobbed through almost all of this project, which forced me to
  work on my communication skills. Everyone on my team was patient with each other
  and committed to learning and to turning out a good project. Only on the last
  night, when we were confident in getting a solid 3 on functionality, did we each
  try to implement our own extension and each person produced, giving us that 4.
  Great team.  


Feedback to Me
--------------------------------------

While we were not supposed to solicit feedback, I am including feedback I
received from MB. After she told it to me person to person, I wrote it down
because it seemed to be highly accurate and useful!
"You have a tendency to slowly stop talking through what your doing when you
'get lost' in coding." She also suggested that during those times, I hand over the keyboard, forcing myself to talk through my thought processes. I implemented this
idea well during the traffic spy project and recognized the same trait showing up
during Little Shop. When I noticed it, I handed over the keyboard, but need to
get better at realizing when I am narrowing my focus so much that I stop talking.


Community
-------------------------------------

###Giving Feedback

I usually take more time on the feedback forms than is allotted because I try to put
forth real feedback. This is mostly due to me feeling like Turing actually puts
this solicited feedback to use. I have filled out each form asked of me that I am
aware of.  

###Playing a Part

* http://turingwithgeorge.tumblr.com is still ongoing. I have tried to add both
  technical information as well as "the turing experience." Though I have tried
  to post about a post per day, I am 2 1/2 weeks behind this goal. Despite this,
  I have well over 50 posts about my time at Turing so far.
* I interviewed with Course Report in their Aulumni Spotlight section which can
  be read here: https://www.coursereport.com/schools/turing#/reviews
* I started up and lead the Turing Kids Who Code community classes. My motivations
  for this were:
    1) I wanted to teach my daughters how to program and kept putting it off (it
      was always easier to play games with them!). By making myself accountable
      to a slightly larger community, I prioritize my preparation more.
    2) I feel Jeff has given me a great opportunity and I wanted to find some way
      to pass that spirit of giving on.
    3) I wanted to get experience talking in front of groups and teaching.

    * I realized before starting it would be a difficult undertaking to take this
      on, especially with time constraints. What I did not understand was how much
      of a leadership role this would put me in. I find myself trying to organize
      and lead the other students interested in helping out. I feel in this area,
      (which is my weakest of those talked about) is where I will benefit the
      most from heading up Turing Kids Who Code.
