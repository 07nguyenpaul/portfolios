# Michael Wong - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

The main focus area I had when entering this module was breaking an old habit of quickly skimming across the surface of knowledge and instead trying to understand all concepts more deeply. I would mainly try to accomplish this by ensuring that I could guess what was going to happen when implementing code and then experimenting with other ways of solving a problem once I was able to get one style working.

### Attendance

I was present and on time for all days except for leaving to Washington DC at noon on Friday, August 7th.

### Work

I completed the following individual projects for this module:

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kealii/Chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

This project was fundamentally a markdown to html parser. It was important to be aware of data being nested within other parameters to ensure we were converting the data correctly.

#### Linked Lists

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kealii/LinkedLists)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

This project consisted of creating simple nodes with a single attribute and a list that contains them. The goal was to be able to create methods that would change the list by manipulating nodes.

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kealii/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/enigma.html)

This project required us to build a program that was able to encrypt, decrypt, and crack messages in a complex, changing manner.

Feedback given to me was regarding the need to speak up and let my opinions be heard more. I was told that my ability to be a successful navigator by planning ahead and searching ruby docs was critical.

#### Sales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Kealii/sales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine.markdown)

The Sales Engine project was an exercise to explore the relationships between merchants, customers, and everything in between. The project had many moving pieces and so required a lot of attention to detail to avoid things like duplicated data or incorrect calculations.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Feedback I gave was mostly on pairing projects (sales engine and enigma) and was intended to be critical, yet kind. I tried to also praise good habits as well as critique poor ones in a helpful manner.

### Playing a Part

The main ways that I was able to contribute to the Turing community were tidying up regularly, even when not on cleaning duty, and organizing a LAN party for socializing and networking.
