### Areas of Emphasis

The main focus area I had when entering this module was breaking an old habit
of quickly skimming across the surface of knowledge and instead trying to
understand all concepts more deeply. I would mainly try to accomplish this by
ensuring that I could guess what was going to happen when implementing code and
then experimenting with other ways of solving a problem once I was able to get
one style working.
