# Vanessa Gomez - Module 4 Portfolio

### End of Module Assessment

My progress through the module was assessed by Horace

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vanegomez/goober)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/goober.markdown#iteration-4---accepting-ride-requests-driver)

__Notes:__

* Testing is strong -- good mix of small granular tests and larger,
more sweeping tests
* Nice approach to the data modeling - splitting riders and drivers into
separate tables and managing that complexity
* Some room for improvement around managing data lifecycle (e.g and cost
 calculations) as we're going through various app states
* Pace still needs to be a little quicker -- didn't quite finish final
 iteration

__Evaluation:__

1. Satisfactory Progress 2
2. Ruby Syntax & Style 3
3. Rails Style & API 3
4. Testing 3
5. User Interface 4

### Scale Up

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

Instructor: Horace

Production Deployment & Performance Monitoring 3+
Load Testing / User Scripting 3
Database Load yes
Optimization Techniques 3
Features - Pagination yes
Very solid over all, achieves strong response time using simple but solid techniques include pagination and some view caching.

Next step would be to zero in on a few of the remaining slow queries, especially around the category / loan request queries.

### IdeaBox 2.0

Game UI is fun and useable; fancy use of css
Testing super thorough; seems to cover all cases in the small as well as the large
Firm application of OO style
Rendering logic encapsulated by each game component
Pretty good job of keeping jquery out of most of the code (isolating it to the rendering stuff)
Super solid application of OO JS style

Functional Expectations: 4
TDD: 4
Breaking Logic into Components: 4
Fundamental JS & JS Style: 3
Code Sanitation (JSHint): 3
