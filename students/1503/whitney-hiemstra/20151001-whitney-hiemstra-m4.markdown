### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module, I wanted to learn enough Javascript to be able to
continue to learn more on my own once I'm finished with the program. I ended up
really enjoying JS, but it got away from me towards the end of the module. I think
after acquiring the position at CaptainU, and Horace offering the two mini rails
projects, I got into Rails mode and wanted to nail down some serious rails concepts.
Repetition is how I learn best, so given the chance to play with Rails, make several
projects back to back, I feel pretty confident, which is a first time since starting
Turing. =) I did really enjoy JS though, I thought the Game Time project was awesome,
I'll definitely take some time off, but would like to go back to one/more of my
several rails projects and implement more JS into them...

Getting the CaptainU job is amazing! After speaking with mentors/alumni, I received
some great advice saying, "Either focus on finding a job, or focus on learning, but
if you try to do both, you'll end up doing both half ass." So I felt, "Well, I'm
paying Turing, might as well learn," so I decided to learn and gain as much as I
could this module and focus on job search after... I lucked out!

Apparently, I'm suppose to mention my favorite class... I don't have one that jumps
to mind, but I did like it when we had a balance btwn class time in morning and
work time in the afternoon.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Idea Box

Reviewer: Max Tedford

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whithub/idea_box_2.0)
* [Original Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

* Features: 3
* User Interface: 4
* Testing: 4
* Rails Style: 4
* Ruby Style: 3
* JS Style: 3

Notes:
* Liked that you used FactoryGirl for tests. Liked that you did the form
 validation with the alert Liked that you specified the title and body for
 the keyup filter
* Would have been nice to figure out respond_with rather than respond_to
Index action creates an @ideas variable AND an @idea variable


#### JS Linked List

Reviewer: Morgan Miller

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sallymacnicholas/js_linked_list)

* Functional expectations: 2
* TDD: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* JS Fundamentals: 2
* Looping: 3


#### Scale Up

Reviewer: Horace

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/whithub/keevah.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

* Production Deployment & Performance Monitoring: 3
* Load Testing / User Scripting: 4
* Database Load: yes
* Optimization Techniques: 3
* Features - Pagination yes

Notes:

* Good results - response time is snappy and throughput is solid
good mix of caching and DB optimization; pagination saves us on index pages
* Like seeing use of the cache within models and controllers as well
as in the views; next step is to keep thinking critically about how these
different caches are getting layered or nested



#### Practice Assessment

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team project:

#### Game Time w/ Sally MacNicholas

Reviewer: Horace

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/sallymacnicholas/game_time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

This project was to learn how to build a game that is playable in the browser.

* Functional Expectations: 4
* TDD: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental JS & JS Style: 3
* Code Sanitation (JSHint): 3

Notes:
* UI is awesome and colorful; animations and user feedback are very helpful; some
  of them could be sped up a tad
* Feature set is good; game feels complete, can play different cards, etc
* Testing is pretty solid and thorough at covering different game scenarios
* Testing could eventually get pruned a bit, but we're starting from a good
  position of covering the scenarios, so that is good
* Game structure takes a solid OO approach
* Some opportunities remain for refactoring and reducing duplication
* Keep working on pushing Jquery out of the main game logic



## Community

### Playing a Part

* I'll be real, I didn't do as much as I thought or really hoped I'd do this
module. I wanted to be a diligent note taker/resource for my classmates, but
felt all over the place this module. I was hoping to do more lightning talks
to get better at speaking, which I still have a huge interest in, but unfortunately,
time was not my friend this module; my lightning talk is tomorrow and I haven't
really started... It was definitely very frustrating this module to see it though...
I felt like I finally got into a grove with projects and work flow, got extremely
interested in side features, but there seemed to be no time for any of it.
I did attend a few meetups to support Turing student/grads who were speaking,
but I just couldn't juggle school work, job hunt, wedding, and health.
