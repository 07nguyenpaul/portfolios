# Brett Grigsby - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for this module was to get comfortable with Javascript, and what I actually
got a better understanding of functional programming. Turing usually takes my desire
to learn something, and teach me a better understanding of the concepts that 
encapsulate that something. So thanks for that.

Great job working through a fairly complicated project in a new language and environment. Appreciate your hard work experimenting with a lot of technical unknowns.
Use of clojurescript and websocket connections is pretty idiomatic, and you did a good job of working with reagent to construct the frontend.
