# Max Tedford - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

After my last portfolio review I was asked by the staff to continue to be a community
leader that cultivates the ethos of the cohort/school, organize fun activities to
keep people involved, and focus more on the soft side of things, particularly the Turing
culture. As such, I once again spearheaded Turing Field Day which took place on Friday,
September 18th, in addition to serving on Student Advisory Board for the second consecutive
module. I attended all six sessions. In response to staff feedback at the end of module 3,
I decided to pivot away from the wine-themed three-part series of lightning talks I had lined
up to discuss Alan Turing and his cultural influence on the Turing School, its curriculum,
and its culture of inclusion. Finally, I made a point at the beginning of the module to cultivate
my posse and serve as a supportive leader amongst my more junior peers. I accomplished this by
regularly attending and participating in warm-ups, setting up pairing sessions with my posse classmates
and scheduling times to stay late or come in early to assist them with their projects.
 
Simultaneously, my biggest personal goal was to hit the job hunt hard and find a job in Washington DC
by graduation. Whether I actually have a job by the day I graduate is admittedly a but out of my
control, but the level of effort I dedicate towards finding one is not. Over the course of the
module I secured interviews with LivingSocial, Contactually, TrackMaven, WeddingWire, CustomInk,
Morning Consult, and LearnZillion. I completed code challenges for Contactually and Morning Consult,
and am presently in the midst of the recruiting process with Morning Consult, WeddingWire, CustomInk,
and LearnZillion. In addition, I've applied to countless jobs via online portals and activated my DC
network in the hopes of finding additional opportunities. I am overall pleased with my job-hunt efforts,
though I remain disappointed that I haven't yet nailed down a position.

## Individual

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Revenge of IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/revenge_of_idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

In this three-day project I re-implemented IdeaBox using JavaScript. It was peer-evaluated by Whitney with the
following results:

Reviewer: Whitney Hiemstra

* Features -- 3: All of the base expectations were met
* User Interface -- 4: The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use
* Testing -- 3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features
* Rails Style -- 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC,
and push business logic down where it belongs
* Ruby Style -- 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored
* JavaScript Style -- 4: Developer writes code that is exceptionally clear and well-factored

* Comments:
Liked how your files and code were well-organized -- JS code was all in one file, but very easy to read and understand.
Liked your use of respond_with and ajax calls -- site was responsive and quick.

* Improvements:
Would have liked to see a before_action in controller -- replacing all the Idea.find(params[:id])

#### LinkedListJS

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/linked_list_js)

In this weekend project I implemented an object-oriented recursive linked list using JavaScript. It was
peer-evaluated by Margarett with the following results:

Reviewer: Margarett Ly

* Functional Expectations 3: Application fulfills all base expectations
* Test-Driven Development 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and
integration using appropriate data
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with
a clear, single responsibility
* Javascript Fundamentals 4: Application makes excellent use of JS techniques, including fluid and consistent
manipulation of Objects and Functions
* Looping or Recursion 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques

* Comments: 
Code very compact and well divided for each object model. It's easy to look at each method and understand
what your code does. Excellent use of recursion. Tests are clear and straight-forward. I like that you called methods
that you had already written from within other methods. Naming is a little ambiguous.

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/scale_up)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

This was a ten-day project in which I inherited a prior pivot and optimized it for scale. It was evaluated by Horace
with the following results:

* Production Deployment and Performance Monitoring 3
* Load Testing / User Scripting 3
* Database Load yes
* Optimization Techniques 3
* Features - Pagination yes

* Comments:
Good average perf/throughput (150/200ms , 200-300 rpm range)
Load script is thorough and covers our bases
uses good balance of view caching and basic query optimization thanks to pagination
Next steps would be to investigate more of the problematic queries, especially around categories, and also leverage
caching more at the data layer

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### SupperSkip

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/levthedev/supper_skip)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

In this ten-day project I worked with Lev and Jamie to transition a Dinner Dash project that
belonged to a previous cohort into a multi-tenancy restaurant platform. The project was evaluated
by Jorge with the following results:

* Feature Completion - 4
* Project Organization - 4
* Test-Driven Development - 4
* Code Quality - 3.5
* User Experience - 2

### Feedback to Me

I sent around a google form to the rest of my cohort-mates to solicit feedback to me. I got six replies. Here were the results:

Am I easy to communicate with?
* Always (6)

I benefit Turing as a whole
* Strongly Agree (6)

How would you describe my contributions to groups and teams?
* You were the glue that kept us together (4)
* You pulled your weight (2)

How would you describe my work ethic?
* Highly motivated and consistent (5)
* Strong (1)

Additional optional comments from peers:
* So, looking back, I haven't personally worked with you in a group, which is a bummer because I've seen how
you work with others and it seems very collaborative, respective environment, which makes it a great learning
environment. One project in particular, Supper Skip, I saw how well you helped you and your group plan out
the project, put together well-written stories, and made sure everyone in the group was on the same page and
understood the direction of the project. You took a leadership role with Supper Skip and it appeared to have
really worked well. Your team seemed really on track, focused, and very collaborative. Wished we had a chance
to work together. I think I would have learned a lot from you.
* Very motivated and organized.  Great to work with and an awesome person overall.
* I'm actually surprised you dont already have a job. You are a rockstar.
* Max is one of those rare people who is a strong performer, wrapped in a humble shell.  He is easy to
approach, does not condescend when explaining things, and lends a can-do outlook to his peers. When I say
Max was the glue that kept our team together, I can't emphasize enough how much of an impact he had on the
focus and direction we maintained. From the beginning he set the tone, and without actively announcing
himself as the lead, Max delegated and outlined the work flow through suggestions and prompted group
discussion. I would work with him again without hesitation.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Rob and Whitney requested feedback from me for their portfolios. I completed both their requests.

### Playing a Part

* On Friday, July 17, I delivered a lightning talk "Wine 102: How Technology is Changing the Wine Industry"
* On Friday, July 24, I purchased and delivered breakfast for all of Turing
* On Friday, July 31, I organized a Turing field day for students, staff, and families
* Throughout the duration of the module I participated in Student Advisory Board, providing
feedback to the staff on improving Turing. I unfortunately had to be absent from SAB on Thursday,
July 9 and Thursday, August 6. Otherwise, I attended regularly.
