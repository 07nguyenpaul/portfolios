# Max Tedford - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Entering module 3 I felt like my front-end skills were still quite raw and undeveloped,
and I wanted to circle back to M1-type Ruby algorithmic practice to keep them sharp after M2,
where we worked mostly in Rails. Thusly, my two main goals this module were to put a concerted
effort into drilling more advanced Ruby techniques and building my front-end skill-set to make
myself a more versatile and well-rounded full-stack developer.
 
I turned to Exercism to both drill my advanced Ruby algorithmic skills and also get more experience
with JavaScript. I did 2 Exercisms each week, varying Ruby and JavaScript, and also consciously
took on a self-directed project that was challenging and pushed me outside my front-end comfort
zone.

### End of Module Assessment/Self-Directed Project

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with no tardies or absences.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Recursive Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jcasimir/recursive_linked_list)
* [Original Assignment](http://github.com/turingschool/challenges/linked_list.markdown)

In this three-day project I implemented a linked list with recursion. It was
evaluated by Horace with the following results:

"This is one of the better linked list implementations I've ever seen."

* Ruby Syntax: 3
* Decomposition: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3

#### Robodoku

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jcasimir/robodoku)
* [Original Assignment](http://github.com/turingschool/challenges/robodoku.markdown)

In this week-long project I built a sudoku-solving machine. It was
evaluated by Steve with the following results:

"Good object decomposition, but it only solves the easiest of puzzles."

* Ruby Syntax: 3
* Decomposition: 4
* Functionality: 2
* Test-Driven Development: 3

### Feedback to Me

In the previous module feedback from my peers encouraged me to ask for help
more frequently rather than get stuck and stay there. This module I set a timer
when I ran into a problem and, if I got to 20 minutes without progress, I'd ask
for help. My feedback this module showed improvement and teammates said I'm a
better collaborator.
