# Max Tedford - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Entering module 3 I felt like my front-end skills were still quite raw and undeveloped,
and I wanted to circle back to M1-type Ruby algorithmic practice to keep them sharp after M2,
where we worked mostly in Rails. Thusly, my two main goals this module were to put a concerted
effort into drilling more advanced Ruby techniques and building my front-end skill-set to make
myself a more versatile and well-rounded full-stack developer.
 
I turned to Exercism to both drill my advanced Ruby algorithmic skills and also get more experience
with JavaScript. I did 2 Exercisms each week, varying Ruby and JavaScript, and also consciously
took on a self-directed project that was challenging and pushed me outside my front-end comfort
zone.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with no tardies or absences.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### APICurious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/apicurious)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/apicurious.markdown)

In this three-day project I implemented a Twitter emulator using the Twitter API. It was
evaluated by Horace with the following results:

* Server-Side Application and APIs: 3 - Project wraps/isolates external API but has some gaps or external 
connections in its testing.
* Test-Driven Development: 2 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>60%), but does not adequately 
balance feature and unit tests.
* Features: 3 - All planned features were delivered.
* Interface: 3 - The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes
 in lesser-used functionality.

#### RalesEngine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/maxtedford/rales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rales_engine.markdown)

In this three-day project I built an app that provided API endpoints for consumption. It was
evaluated by Jorge with the following results:

* Completion: 2 - Project completes most requirements but fails 4 or fewer spec harness tests
* Rails and ActiveRecord Style: 4 - Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries,
including some advanced query functionality such as joins or includes
* Ruby Style and Code Quality: 3 - Project uses idiomatic Ruby with a handful of larger methods or
bloated controllers
* API Design: 2 - Project has inconsistencies or gaps in how its JSON data is organized or formatted
Test Driven Design: 2 - Project focuses tests on only a single layer of the stack, or has large gaps
in the coverage

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### SupperSkip

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/levthedev/supper_skip)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

In this ten-day project I worked with Lev and Jamie to transition a Dinner Dash project that
belonged to a previous cohort into a multi-tenancy restaurant platform. The project was evaluated
by Jorge with the following results:

* Feature Completion - 4
* Project Organization - 4
* Test-Driven Development - 4
* Code Quality - 3.5
* User Experience - 2

### Feedback to Me

After the previous module, feedback from my peers was very complimentary, lauding me as a great
partner in group projects and as an unspoken leader of the cohort.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

According to the Feedback application:

* I delivered 100% of the requested feedback
* 96% of those submissions were approved and delivered
* 84% of my submissions were meaningful to the recipient

### Playing a Part

* On Friday, July 17, I delivered a lightning talk "Hello, Mr. Roboto"
* On Friday, July 24, I purchased and delivered breakfast for all of Turing
* On Friday, July 31, I organized a Turing field day for students, staff, and families
* Throughout the duration of the module I participated in Student Advisory Board, providing
feedback to the staff on improving Turing. I unfortunately had to be absent from SAB on Thursday,
July 9 and Thursday, August 6.
