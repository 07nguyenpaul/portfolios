# Drew Conly - M2 Portfolio

##Individual

###Areas of Emphasis

This module was an introduction to Rails for me. As I had zero technical
experience prior to Turing, my goal is and has been to establish the strongest
foundation that I'm able in order to have a solid starting point for a career
before me. As Rails is used to deploy web applications, my specific goal was to
host a respectable app online.

###End of Module Assessment

â€œWorking with Drew was great. He is definitely a hard worker and was willing to
put in the work to get stuff done. Drew is also really good at keeping up a
positive attitude and this helps to reduce the stress in the group"

###Community

###Giving Feedback

I provided feedback for all team members for respective projects as well as for
those from other cohorts that I've paired with.

###Playing a Part

* Across cohorts as well as with mentors, I do my best to assert positivity.
* I delivered a lightning talk regarding taking advice as it was something that
  troubled me during module 1 in particular.
* I organized a camping trip to Turquoise Lake during the intermission week
  preceding module 2.
* I introduced several graduating students to former colleagues of mine in the
  staffing industry hoping that it helped them to get jobs.
