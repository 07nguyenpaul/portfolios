# My Mission

My goal coming in to Turing was to explore a new adventure. Then I had to repeat module one and the mission changed a bit. After grinding through the basics again, my goal at Turing is now to absorb as much as possible while figuring out which portions of the process and community appeal to me most.

In Module 2 I want to focus on some of the front-end options to make sure that I have a few of those "full-stack" skills, and the ability to work through a full project.

# Goals for Module 2

* Learn and hone HTML and CSS styling to improve full-stack abilities and explore a more creative side of things.

* Solid understanding of SQL and other database resources and tools.

* I want to try to be more sure that people are giving me honest feedback, and that I am making actual use of that feedback.

# Non-Evaluated Projects

This time through I took Jeff's advice to "do Foxtrot and crush it." There are only two real solo projects for Foxtrot. My scores and notes are below.

### Being a community member
<!-- Change this for mod 2 stuff -->
During my second-try at the first module here at Turing I've mostly just tried to make sure I was getting what I needed out of the program, and figuring out where I can fit in.
I recently took the lead on pushing up a Turing podcast. Production halted over the holidays, but I hope to get it picked back up very soon. I also attended most of the ~~DSA~~ Clarke Coin meetings hosted by Horace after school twice a week and took part in the Improv elective on Tuesdays.


## Review

### Notes

* bring back the podcast
* keep clarke coin alive
* consistently been an active and core member of the group; really
appreciate your influence on the group dynamic for 1511
* happy to see the second attempt go so much better -- hope you
will take time to reflect on what worked better the last time
* would love to see you organizing the cohort things that people can "opt in" to
