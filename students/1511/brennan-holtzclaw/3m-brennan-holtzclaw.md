# Brennan Holtzclaw Module 3 Portfolio

# My Mission

My goal coming in to Turing was to explore a new adventure. Then I had to repeat module one and the mission changed a bit. After grinding through the basics again, my goal at Turing is now to absorb as much as possible while figuring out which portions of the process and community appeal to me most.

In Module 3 I want to become comfortable working with third-party APIs. On top of that I want to strengthen my Rails skills throughout the module.

# Goals for Module 3

* Rails

* AJAX

* Javascript

* API

## Blog Post

## Mentor Sessions

I meet with my mentor, Travis Yoder, for 60 to 90 minutes every week.

#### Notes
Assessed By: Nate

Assessor Notes:

* Remember to buy Nate a big hat
* Polish the UX you have before you stretch for new UX or features. Red means stop, green means go
* Learn Selenium later. Like on another project
* Try to keep models in the models folder. PORO's would go in the lib folder.

## Rales Engine

#### Notes
Assessed By: Nate

Assessor Notes:

* Could DRY out controllers if you like
* You've sacrificed data integrity to make your JSON match the spec harness
* Good test coverage, but could be DRYer
* Verbose routes file which is fine

Repository: https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/rails_engine

#### Scores

***Completion:*** **3** -  Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.

***TDD:*** **4** - Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

***Code Quality:*** **3** - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

***API Design:*** **3** -  Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.
