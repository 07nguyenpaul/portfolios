# Brennan Holtzclaw Module 3 Portfolio

# My Mission

My goal coming in to Turing was to explore a new adventure. Then I had to repeat module one and the mission changed a bit. After grinding through the basics again, my goal at Turing is now to absorb as much as possible while figuring out which portions of the process and community appeal to me most.

In Module 3 I want to become comfortable working with third-party APIs. On top of that I want to strengthen my Rails skills throughout the module.

# Goals for Module 3

* Rails

* AJAX

* Javascript

* API

## Blog Post

## Mentor Sessions

I meet with my mentor, Travis Yoder, for 60 to 90 minutes every week.

## End of Module Assessment

#### Notes

Assessed by: Josh M.

Exercise: Serve and Consume API

* Using hashes in the view instead of objects.
* Works for single search term (had a pry session in there.)
* Nice use of serializer for formatting.

#### Scores

***Ruby Style:*** **3** -  Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components

***Rails Syntax and API:*** **3** -  Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack. The application displays good judgement in modeling the problem as data. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

***Testing:*** **3** - Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality. Most new lines of code are tested.

***Progression/Completion:*** **3** - Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a junior developer.

***Workflow:*** **4** - Developer commits every 15 minutes

# Evaluated Projects

## The Pivot

Group: Nick W., Charissa, Lenny, Brennan

#### Notes
Assessed By: Nate

Assessor Notes:

* Remember to buy Nate a big hat
* Polish the UX you have before you stretch for new UX or features. Red means stop, green means go
* Learn Selenium later. Like on another project
* Try to keep models in the models folder. PORO's would go in the lib folder.

Repository: https://github.com/JaggedLaw/the_pivot

#### Scores

***Completion:*** **3** - Team completed all the user stories nd requirements set by the client.

***Organization:*** **4** - Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.

***Git Workflow*** **3** - Team always used pull requests to introduce code to their project.

***TDD:*** **3** - Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).

***Code Quality:*** **3** - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

***User Experience:*** **3** - Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

***Risk Taking (Extensions):*** **4** - Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature.

## Rales Engine

#### Notes
Assessed By: Nate

Assessor Notes:

* Could DRY out controllers if you like
* You've sacrificed data integrity to make your JSON match the spec harness
* Good test coverage, but could be DRYer
* Verbose routes file which is fine

Repository: https://github.com/brennanholtzclaw/rails_engine

#### Scores

***Completion:*** **3** -  Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.

***TDD:*** **4** - Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.

***Code Quality:*** **3** - Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

***API Design:*** **3** -  Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features.

***Queries*** **4** - Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality.

### Being a community member
This module I continued to publish podcasts when possible, and I got it set up on a much more reliable distribution network. I am also a member of the Ritchie Posse.


# Self Assessment

## Portfolio Rubric

Your portfolio will be evaluated using the following rubric. Earning at least
a three in each category is the baseline for promotion/graduation.

### A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

* 3: Student achieved a "3" or better on each category of the assessment || excused from assessment

### B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

* 3: Student demonstrates commitment and growth in their work through satisfactory
evaluations of each project or a clearly upward-sloping trend.
* 2: Student demonstrates some lack of engagement or growth in their individual
skill or project outcomes without a clear upward trend.

### C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

* 3: Student fully participates in their group work to facilitate group harmony
while achieving consistently satisfactory results.

### D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

* 3: Student participates in required activities and does at least one or two
above-and-beyond supports of the community.

### E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

* 3: Student consistently delivers meaningful feedback for peers and implements
strategies to improve themselves in response to feedback.

(Hopefully that's what we're doing right now)
