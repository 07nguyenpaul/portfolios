# Allan Maxwell Blair - M2 Portfolio

### Your Mission

Learn as much as possible during my time at Turing. Capitalize on the intellectual freedom that comes along with being a student. Pave the way for those who come after me and support those who came before.

### Goals

1. Gain an understanding of what is going on behind the scenes between a client and the server (Middleware, Server software, HTTP protocol)
2. Begin working on an open source project in Go
3. Be more social and go to more meet ups

### Results

1. Have experimented hosting my own website using a Raspberry Pi and hosting a chat application using a Digital Ocean droplet
2. Began working on Vici a A simple continuous integration server for multi-platform testing with Ben Johnson
3. Go meet up at SendGrid - 2/25/2016; Half an EMACs meet up at Turing - 3/3/2016
