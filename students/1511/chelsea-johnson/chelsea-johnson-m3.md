### Posse Work

### Feedback to Group Members

#### Feedback to David Whitacker
I had a lot of fun working with David on the Pivot. His optimsim and enthusiasm made the project much more enjoyable. He was not daunted by implementing new concepts and produced really solid code. And most of all, I enjoyed our Danceadoros! I don't have any constructive feedback really, keep it up Damwhit!

#### Feedback to Erinna Chen
Erinna was a boss on our pivot project. She had to stamp out numerous fires started by David and myself. She also takes the time to explain unfamiliar concepts to group members. At the beginning of the project, I interpreted Erinna's tone as slightly condescending when I asked for her opinion. However, this tone went away completely as the project progressed. I know she has been working on this, and it shows! Keep it up Erinna, you're awesome!


#### Feedback to Heidi Hoopes
I love my nerd sister! Not only is she an extremely talented developer, but she is also kind, caring, and optimistic. I have enjoyed being a posse leader with her and look forward to continuing the position next module. When developing, she is not afraid of taking on challenges and seeks elegant solutions to her problems. Heidi is always thinking of others, and also takes time to volunteer for Kids Who Code and other Turing events. Heidi- you rock, and I am proud to call you my friend!

## Evaluated Projects

### The Pivot

Evaluated by: Josh M.

Repo: https://github.com/damwhit/the_pivot

Notes:

- Worked through learning goals successfully. A little light on features relative to other groups. Seems like soft skills are the reason why and not so much technical reasons. Would love for each group member to make a special effort to monitor their process for future projects this module. Good use of Waffle and Github. Great use of testing.

* 3: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature.
* **2: Developers attempted to implement extensions using technologies not covered in class but it did not result in a delivered feature.**
* 1: Developers but did not build any extensions.

### Rails Engine

Evaluated by: Nate

Repo: https://github.com/cheljoh/rails_engine

Notes

- Other ways to organize controllers. REST is a property of the API, not the code
- You're using active record, but don't fully understand what's going on. Play with the SQL and look at some tables
- Good test coverage
-

#### Feature Delivery

**1. Completion**

* 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
* **3: Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.**

* **4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.**
* 3: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
* 2: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>70%) but does not adequately balance controller and unit tests.
* 1: Project does not have 70% test coverage.
