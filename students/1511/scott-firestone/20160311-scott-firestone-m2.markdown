# Scott Firestone - Module 2 Portfolio

## Individual

### My Mission

#### Technical Goals
With Module 2, I wish to gain a proficiency with Rails. More specifically, by the time the module is complete, I would like to have built my own E-commerce side-project site, which accept real payments. I would also like to have made a meaningful contribution to the side-project helping a charter school in Las Vegas.

Additionally, I want to focus on approving my testing skills, while pushing myself to improve my test-driven development.

#### Soft Skill Goal
For Module 2, considering the amount of side-work I'd like to accomplish, I want to build more structure to organize my time. I will create weekly goals to drive my outside-of-class time.
