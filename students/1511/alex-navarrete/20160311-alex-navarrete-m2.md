# Alexis Navarrete - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

###Goals
* I would like to improve my technical skills when it comes to thinking logically on how to solve problems through Rails. I believe if I can get a good understanding of the problem before starting, it will benefit me in completing it in an efficient manner.

* Going the extra mile in learning and understanding things that wasn't required within the curriculum. I would like to dedicate more time in reading books that go even further with whatever we are going to learn in this module. I have some tutorials that I would love to really get into whenever I have some free time.

* For my soft-skills goal, I'd like to be able to improve my way of helping others when they're stuck in a problem by explaining it in a way that they can understand. As of now, I feel like whenever I explain to someone on how they should approach a problem it seems like they never understand it from me.
