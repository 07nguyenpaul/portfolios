### Evaluated Projects
## Traffic Spy [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amaxwellblair/rush-hour-skeleton)
* Evaluated by Andrew Carmer
* Notes: Notes: All base functionality except for missing payload in posting payload; implemented client registration from browser interface. Great use of testing at all levels. Make sure that you test attributes and relationships instead of just existance. Good use of POROs to delegate responsibilities.

# Scores
* Functional Expectations
  3: Application fulfills base expectations

* Test-Driven Development
  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

* Fundamental Ruby & Style
  4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic
  4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.

* View Layer
  4: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.

### Playing a Part

  * Participated in the computability theory club that meets on Wednesday mornings before class. I have a deep interest in machine learning and computational processes, especially as they relate to artificial intelligence
  * Part of the 1602 greeting party that was hosted just before the module began, and I also volunteerd to help the upcoming 1603 module with prep-work
  * Active participant in all posse meetings before school--worked with posse on all challenges and worked with other students in our posse on their projects
