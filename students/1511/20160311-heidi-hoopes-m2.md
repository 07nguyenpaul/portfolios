Goals

1. Learn a gem or technique used for data validation or sanitizing and use it to implement more secure web applications.

2. Document any significant technical challenge I have in a format that I can then publish online. This is partially to assist my laziness in documenting problems and being forced to then revisit them later, and partially to practice my technical communication and documentation skills.  

3. Balance solo learning with seeking assistance, based on recognizing when I need help, overcoming inertia or pride to seek out a source of help, and maintaining a consistent relationship with a mentor.
