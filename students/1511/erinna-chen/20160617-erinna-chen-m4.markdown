# Erinna Chen - Module 3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
__By the end of Turing, I would like to:__
* be a rockstar! But barring that...
* have career options that incorporate my love of programming and my background in mathematics and large-scale computing
* be comfortable with using the tools and languages that enable the development of websites and applications
* be a active member of the Turing community and the development community at large
* have a portfolio that incorporates academic work and a significant number of personally-driven projects
* have strong personal relationships with students and staff of Turing and with mentors outside of Turing

Perhaps my goals were rather vague, and I didn't actually review them when I should have. I think I did accomplish the things that I wanted. Maybe fame and fortune will come in the near future.

Because yes.

### Final Score
Yay Points! 1066 out of 1138

### Attendance
I was present all days this module, with some random meetings and such which I stepped out for.

__Evaluation by Nate:__

- Can explain all your choices
- Talked about other ways to do things
- I learned something about joins, which is good, because it's poorly documented

__Scores:__

1. __Completion- 3:__ Project completes most requirements but fails 5 or fewer spec harness tests.
2. __Test-Driven Development- 4:__ Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
3. __ Code Quality- 4:__ Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
4. __API Design- 4:__ Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
5. __Queries- 4:__ Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as `joins` and `includes`.


#### Scaleup: BoxTango
__Overview:__
* [Github URL](https://github.com/erinnachen/paws-app)

The PAWs app take in photos and returns to the user a "best guess" for the breed if the image is recognized to be a dog. This was a two-week project which involved building two applications: a user interface in Rails with a PostgreSQL database, and a Python app that utilized the Flask web framework, the Keras machine learning library, and the VGG-16 pre-trained model for ImageNet.

__Evaluation by Nate:__

- Pushed yourself. The code suffered a little, but I think you learned a lot.
- Talked about some javascript code organization strategies. Tradeoff of CDNs
- Messy if statements can use rules engines
- Nice use of Rick Astley

__Personal Notes:__
- Heroku is the best. The Python application is still in development and not deployed.
- I definitely underestimated how much time each feature would take; also, I didn't realize how large this project would be
- Testing suffered in that I couldn't figure out what I could do/wanted to do; stress definitely contributed to this.

__Scores:__

1. __Completion- 3:__ Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
2. __Organization- 3:__ Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.
3. __Technical Quality: Test-Driven Development- 3:__ Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
4. __Technical Quality: Code Quality- 3:__ Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
5. __Product Experience: User Experience- 3:__ Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
6. __Product Experience: Performance- 3:__ Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

### Feedback to Me

*  __Adrienne Domingus (1511):__ (GameTime Partner)

Working with Erinna was a highlight of Turing pairing experiences. Not only is she a talented developer, but she shows an impressive commitment to clean code, refactoring, and testing at all phases of her work. Doing this early and often was invaluable to our ability to be successful at later stages of the project. She also shows a willingness to help others, and is fun to be around to boot!

*  __Meeka Gayhart (Instructor Extraordinaire):__

You are an incredibly strong developer. Like, ridiculously strong. On top of being very smart, competent, and a hard worker you also bring a ton of enthusiasm to things that you do. It’s been really fun having you in classes, because you contribute a lot and have good, well thought out and generally constructive feedback. I predict that you will be in working situations where you are the best developer in the room, and if you are aren’t, you will work with the best developer in the room and be the person they think of when they want to pull someone in on a project.

You are also super funny. This is very important. I would love to see you write programming books down the line.

You asked for brutally honest feedback, and we talked about this little at Scale Up Week 1, but my concern for you is that you can sometimes focus too heavily on what other people are doing that I think can lead you to be judgmental. Your frustration when people are blocked on things or not performing well is hard to hide. I would advise you to keep working on building up your ability to assume that everyone is doing the 'best job he or she could, given what was known at the time, his or her skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.’ Not because that’s always true, but because programming is more fun if you can generally work from that assumption.

I’m really, really, really, really excited to see what you do in the next five years and beyond.

### Giving Feedback

*  __Adrienne Domingus (1511):__ (GameTime Partner)
There is no other way to describe Adrienne except that she is a BOSS (I definitely don't say this lightly). Her work habits are clockwork and she works at a crushing pace; I regularly went to bed having finished a pull request and woke up expecting to have comments and new code to look at. I have no idea what she wants out of her programming career, but she will certainly accomplish anything she puts her mind to. I look forward to continuing our pairings and hope that I will get to be involved in anything cool she works on.

* __Ling Tran (1602):__ (Paired up at various points in the module)
Ling is someone that I did not know very well until this module, and now I really enjoy working with her. She is a solid programmer and has the ability to do really challenging things. 


### Playing a Part

* Gave the beginner track talk at the Denver.rb meetup in May
* Attended coffee hour with the Joan Clarke Society
* Kept alive Armstrong Posse activities
* Attended meetings of Clojure Club with Horace
* Did many many dishes
* Answered many many questions

## Looking forward
### Reflections on Module 4
This module definitely flew by. I felt at times that I could be "doing more" whatever that means. This module definitely felt like I was the one responsible for scheduling things, and that really meant that I wasn't doing as much coding as I should have/wanted to be doing. Also, it felt like we built so many boxes this module... that wasn't so fun, but it was kind of fun to see the variety between basically all JavaScript, a mix of Rails/JavaScript, React.

### Reflections on Turing as a whole
I am eternally grateful for my time at Turing. I look back to where I was last year and realized that I easily could have decided to not apply, continued to do the same things I was doing, and been unable to feel confident in my career prospects. I chose Turing because somehow I felt good about the people in the community, and my expectations were exceeded many times over. I'm going to miss the basement and hopefully the basement will miss me.

Sometimes I felt like this:

But today I feel like this:

### Goals for the near future
* Spend time outdoors, take advantage of summer in Denver
* Study up on the data structures and algorithms
* Find a job

## Review
