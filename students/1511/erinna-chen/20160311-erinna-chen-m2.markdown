# Erinna Chen - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
By the end of Turing, I would like to:
* be a rockstar! But barring that...
* have career options that incorporate my love of programming and my background in mathematics and large-scale computing
* be comfortable with using the tools and languages that enable the development of websites and applications
* be a active member of the Turing community and the development community at large
* have a portfolio that incorporates academic work and a significant number of personally-driven projects
* have strong personal relationships with students and staff of Turing and with mentors outside of Turing

In this module, my driving principles are:
* Consistently deliver good projects
* Continue to foster a welcoming community at Turing
* Reach out to more people outside of Turing
* Actively budget time in order to better separate academic requirements, personal development, and personal life
* Get back on the exercise train
* Push forward on some personal projects: lambda calculus, machine learning, blog, learning other programming things (elixir, python, kafka)
* Generally be more active in effectively utilizing the time/resources I have at Turing

__Three beginning of module goals:__
1. Write one blog post weekly (6 total)
2. Create a e-commerce website in Rails
3. Obtain at least 2 pieces of feedback from a person in each category: instructor, mentor, student in 1511, student in another cohort.


### End of Module Assessment

#### Evaluation by Horace
* Exercise: Highest Scoring Word
* took us a few minutes to unwrap the case structure for handling
different situations
* eventually ended up with a flexible approach that made it pretty easy
to handle the additional cases
* straightforward testing throughout the various cases

#### Scores

1. __Ruby Syntax & API:__ 3
2. __Ruby Style:__ 3
3. __Blocks & Enumerations:__ 3
4. __Testing:__ 4
5. __Workflow:__ 3
6. __Collaboration:__ 3

### Mid-Module Assessment

#### Evaluation by Josh:
* Ruby syntax & API looks good
* Good solution, but seemed a bit hesitant
* Mrspec! Great test names
* Some good keyboard commands, some places where you can use it better
* Quit apologizing!
* I liked when we were just doing the "it'll pass" or "fail on 88", kept us in sync and kept the flow moving.

#### Scores
1. __Ruby Syntax & API:__ 4
2. __Ruby Style:__ 3
3. __Testing:__ 4
4. __Workflow:__ 3
5. __Collaboration:__ 3
