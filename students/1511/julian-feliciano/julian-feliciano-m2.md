# End of Module Portfolio

## Your own eval notes

## Blog Post

## Mentor Sessions

## Self-solicited continual and consistent peer feedback

## Not evaluated projects: Sinatra CRUD, Tool Chest, Mix Master, Rails Mini Project

## Evaluated projects: Traffic Spy, Little Shop

## Assessments: mid-module, final

## Goals

1. Digging into the guts of Sinatra & Rails. I have a decent background on both and would like to know more about how they work and the latest updates to Rails (Rails 5).

2. Begin to add some creativity to the projects, adding functionality that is not necessarily apart of the project spec. Get out of the comfort zone of the specs.

3. Work on being more communicative about specific pair programming techniques that I like or don't like. Ask more questions while pair programming ("Am I explaining a specific topic fully? Am I dominating the conversation and giving you a chance to speak? What can I do to be a better pairing partner?")
