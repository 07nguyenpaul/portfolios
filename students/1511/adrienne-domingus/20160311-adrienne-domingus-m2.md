## Evaluation Notes

### Rush Hour
[Project Repo](https://github.com/adriennedomingus/rush_hour)  
[Original Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

#### Scores
**Functional Expectations:** 3  
**Test-Driven Development:** 3.5  
**Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3.5  
**Fundamental Ruby & Style:** 3  
**Sinatra/Web and Business Logic:** 3.5  
**View Layer:** 3

#### Notes
* Functionality: we had a small bug in the hour-by-hour event breakdown, but fixed it quickly after the evaluation
* Testing: Like how payloads are broken out into their own module, but consider how much data you actually need to test the functionality - you don't need 15 payloads. Also - separate integration tests into their own folder.
* Views: we had a couple small bits of logic leaking into the Views
* Liked how much of the server responsibility was broken out into objects with a single responsibility, and had recommendations for how we could implement something similar for paths that included redirects

## Peer Feedback
"Adrienne did an amazing  job of driving our team to complete deliverables in a timely manner. She grasped active record at a lightening pace and fixed bugs that plagued the project when we turned it in because she passionately cared about the team and project. She could treat herself to more of a break in the evenings/weekends in order to have a better school life balance." **-Adam Hundley**

"Adrienne did a good job with taking charge of the project, asking good questions, and being a hard worker because she is a very driven and dedicated person. I think she could be more welcoming and relaxed in order to promote a lighter team environment." **-July Tran**
