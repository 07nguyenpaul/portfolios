### Rush Hour
[Project Repo](https://github.com/adriennedomingus/rush_hour)  
[Original Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

#### Scores
**Functional Expectations:** 2.5  
**Test-Driven Development:** 3.5  
**Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3.5  
**Fundamental Ruby & Style:** TBD  
**Sinatra/Web and Business Logic:** 3.5  
**View Layer:** 3

#### Notes
* Functionality: we had a small bug in the hour-by-hour event breakdown, but fixed it quickly after the evaluation
* Testing: Like how payloads are broken out into their own module, but consider how much data you actually need to test the functionality - you don't need 15 payloads. Also - separate integration tests into their own folder.
* Views: we had a couple small bits of logic leaking into the Views
* Liked how much of the server responsibility was broken out into objects with a single responsibility, and had recommendations for how we could implement something similar for paths that included redirects
