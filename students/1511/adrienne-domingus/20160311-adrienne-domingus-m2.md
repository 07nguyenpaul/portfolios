# Adrienne Domingus - M1 Portfolio

## Mission and Goals
* Write cleaner code from the start
* Regularly pair with 1602 students
* Pair more collaboratively, be comfortable with different skill levels and paces.

## Evaluation Notes

### Rush Hour
[Project Repo](https://github.com/adriennedomingus/rush_hour)  
[Original Project Spec](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

#### Scores
**Functional Expectations:** 3  
**Test-Driven Development:** 3.5  
**Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components:** 3.5  
**Fundamental Ruby & Style:** 3  
**Sinatra/Web and Business Logic:** 3.5  
**View Layer:** 3

#### Notes
* Functionality: we had a small bug in the hour-by-hour event breakdown, but fixed it quickly after the evaluation
* Testing: Like how payloads are broken out into their own module, but consider how much data you actually need to test the functionality - you don't need 15 payloads. Also - separate integration tests into their own folder.
* Views: we had a couple small bits of logic leaking into the Views
* Liked how much of the server responsibility was broken out into objects with a single responsibility, and had recommendations for how we could implement something similar for paths that included redirects

### Little Shop

#### Notes

### Mid-Module Diagnostic

**Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking**: 3.5
**Ruby Syntax & Standard Ligrary**: 3
**Rails Syntax & API**: 4

### Community

## Peer Feedback
"Adrienne did an amazing job of driving our team to complete deliverables in a timely manner. She grasped active record at a lightening pace and fixed bugs that plagued the project when we turned it in because she passionately cared about the team and project. She could treat herself to more of a break in the evenings/weekends in order to have a better school life balance." **-Adam Hundley**

"Adrienne did a good job with taking charge of the project, asking good questions, and being a hard worker because she is a very driven and dedicated person. I think she could be more welcoming and relaxed in order to promote a lighter team environment." **-July Tran**

"Pairing with Adrienne on a weekend Rails project was a bright spot in Turing pairing opportunities. Even if she didn’t have such a strong technical approach and ability to step through new code challenges, I felt like we would’ve been successful due to her methodical completeness and debugging aptitude. Interactions were enjoyable and comfortable because she’s so even-keeled and and patient. I enjoyed both the process and the output. Because she is so well-balanced it’s hard to find an avenue of critique to offer, but I would recommend that she be more forceful when she knows something absolutely, as to give her partners clues to her very stoic input." **-Heidi Hoopes**

"Adrienne is the full package: strong organization, algorithmic thinking, and creativity. This was demonstrated by her leadership role in the Little Shop Project were we successfully completed base functionality several days ahead of schedule. Adrienne can continue to work on stepping out of the box. Given her high level of performance she can expertly stay with in the lines even if client requirements require her to jump through hoops. This may not always be the right answer and should be weighed with skepticism given she is the expert."**-Allan Blair**
