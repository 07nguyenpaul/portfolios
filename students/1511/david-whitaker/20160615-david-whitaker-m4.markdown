# David Whitaker - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis
This module, I wanted to really dive deep into JavaScript and learn a badass framework like React.  I was also hoping to get a badass job doing software development.  Fortunately I was able to accomplish the first two goals and the second one has some potentially promising prospects (fingers crossed!).

## End of Mod Assessment
- Didn't need to take due to having enough points to pass the module prior to.

## Feedback

### Giving Feedback
- For Adrienne: “Adrienne and I haven’t had the chance to pair during any of our modules, and it makes me sad as I feel I would have learned a lot.  We are in the Brin Posse together where the objective is to finish as many exercisms as possible before graduation.  Adrienne has blown everyone out of the water.  Not only is she a brilliant programmer, but she’s also great at building people up.  She is very genuine and her words of encouragement have made my day a few times throughout the modules.  I can’t wait to see where she ends up.  I know she’s bound for big things!"

- For Brian: “I had the opportunity to pair with Brian on our game time project.  He has a unique ability to think outside the box in approaching problems.  There was a point where our collision detection wasn’t working for our bottom boundary and I tried a ton of things to fix it.  Brian quickly thought to randomize the y instead of the height for those bottom boundary objects, and vuala it was fixed.  I also really appreciated his commitment and focus on testing during the project.  I’m confident that he’ll be a valuable member at whatever team he ends up on."

- For Adam: "Adam is a really talented developer with a strong drive.  I really admire his work ethic and fearlessness in tackling new challenges.  We spend a lot of time working with one another and I always appreciate his opinion and get a ton of benefit from bouncing ideas off of him.  I also look forward to staying friends after turing and hope that we can continue to push each other as programmers too.  I think that sky’s the limit for his abilities and I look forward to seeing what the future holds."

### Being a Community Member
- From Adrienne: "I never actually paired with David during any of our modules, so I'm pretty sure I missed out there, but nonetheless, David had a consistently positive impact on our cohort culture. He always had an encouraging word for anyone who needed it, and showed a dedication to producing high quality work and learning as much as he could. I'm confident he'll be a great addition to any company he joins, both for his attitude and programming abilities."

-  From Adam: "David is one of my go to guys. Whenever I have a question, problem or need an opinion, David is there to lend a hand. He is turing into a great developer. I look forward to staying friends with him after Turing and seeing how our professional lives can intertwine."

### Playing a Part
- Just to preface: I feel like I started the job search before most folks and spent a lot of my time reaching out to people, cold emailing, meeting with potential employers, doing code challenges and stressing about jobs, and therefore did not contribute as much to the community this module compared to modules passed.

- Taught git flow class to some module 1ers on Friday, June 10th to clear up any git related issues and anxieties.

- Consistently put out fires for students in lower modules.

- Attended Denver RB on June 14th to both support Adam in his beginner track talk and to see the wonderful, amazing Mike Pack give a badass talk on profiling, benchmarking and optimization.  First meetup outside of Turing!!
