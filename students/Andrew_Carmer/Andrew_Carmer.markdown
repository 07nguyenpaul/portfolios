Areas of Emphasis

I focused a lot on Javascript this module and the end of the last. I'm comfortable with testing Javascript now, though I still need some work. I feel competent with JavaScript at this point, but I still get stumped sometimes. I think this is how my relationship with JavaScript will always be, but I'm excited to start building some new things.

Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

Scale Up

GitHub URL: github.com/carmer/scale-up
Original Assignment:
 The goal of the scale up was to become familiar with performance optimization techniques and tools to measure the performance of you application.
following results: My experience with the project was subpar. I learned a lot, but I didn't get to dig into optimization as much as I would have liked to. I assessed with Steve and received one 3 and many 2's.

He said it I seemed to understand the practices and techniques, however I failed to fully implement them in the project.

(not on ruby submissions. I believe it was a 1 :(, mostly 2's and a 3. )

Feedback to Me

My feedback has always been positive. I asked Rachel in Module 2, if she had any advice for me and if I could do anything to improve. Her feedback was representative of what I keep hearing. She liked the questions I asked and my attitude. I appreciate the positive feedback I get, but I can't seem to get constructive, how to improve yourself, kind of feedback. Kenny is the only person that is really blunt with me. He tells me I need to "chill out" a little. I often take things "too seriously", and stress about it.
