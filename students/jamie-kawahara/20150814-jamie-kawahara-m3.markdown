# Jamie Kawahara - Module 3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into the module I felt very shy.  This module, I offered
to help module 1 students, taught a student led session, and started a blog.
I feel like I've made a lot of friends, networked and helped people be more
creative at Turing through 3D printing.


### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exceptions of:
* Friday, July 24th (dental work)
* Friday, July 31st (friend visiting from out-of-state)
* Friday, August 7th (dental work)

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Self-Directed Project: 3D Spark!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/androidgrl/turing-world-of-things)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.markdown)

3D Spark is a website that brings the best of Thingiverse to novice 3D printers.
It allows users to login with Twitter, browse through 3D designs and select what
they want to print easily.  3D Spark is an image-centric website which focuses on
distilling the information from Thingiverse into a more simple and easy-to-use format.

* Completion: 4 - Developer completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
* Organization: 4 - Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* Test-Driven Development: 3 - 91.5% (Omniauth not tested)
* Code Quality: 3 - Good use of Service object and Background workers. Could refactor Service usage duplication, using a presenter in the controller, and using ActiveRecord to limit records loaded into memory.
* User Experience: 3 - Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
Performance: 3 - Project pages load on average under 400 milliseconds.

### Playing a Part

* At the end of Module 1 I proposed the "Turing Cup" idea to Jorge.
* At the end of Module 2 I printed the first "Posse Cup".
* On Friday, July 17th, I ran a student-led workshop on 3D printing on the Lulzbot.
* On Tuesday, July 21st, I organized a team to represent Turing at the PebbleRocksBoulder Hackathon.
* On Wednesday, July 29th, I published an article for "Built In Colorado", called
["Is dev school right for you?  Here's what an average day really looks like"](http://www.builtincolorado.com/2015/07/29/dev-school-right-you-here-what-average-day-really-looks)
* On Friday, July 31st, I published a blog post ["How To Use a Kinect to Make a 3D Scan and Print"](http://androidgrl.github.io/)
* On Friday, August 14th, I organized a tour of the Lulzbot facility for Turing.
