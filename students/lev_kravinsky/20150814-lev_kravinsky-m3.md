#Lev Kravinsky - M3 Portfolio

###Individual

Areas of Emphasis

This module, I spent a lot of time on side projects. I also a little time working with Angular, and dove deeper into Ruby, learning about lambdas, yield/block.call, Fiber, and metaprogramming techniques. I also did a lot of networking and travelled to New York and San Francisco to meet with companies that interested me for interviews. In addition, I started a program for myself where I get coffee with someone who inspires me every week - so far, it has been a huge success and has been one of the single biggest aids to me in terms of programming ability, my job hunt, social skills, project ideas, etc. I think other people should try this out as well.

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an absence on Thursday, July 17th and Friday, July 18th, for PovertyHack2015, where I helped CUPeru win $5000.

Feature Completion - 4
Project Organization - 4
Test-Driven Development - 4
Code Quality - 3.5
User Experience - 2

Jorge said our project 'had the best back end he'd seen all day', and our group had the highest cumulative score (17.5/20  - the average class score was 14.5) out of all of 1503. I had a really great time working with Max and Jamie too, this was one of the most pleasant groups I've worked with.

Server-Side Application and APIs: 2
Test-Driven Development: 3
Features: 3
Interface: 3

This project was very enjoyable and useful for me; I learned a ton about consuming an API, controller tests, VCR, and bootstrap.

Ruby Style and Code Quality: 3
API Design: 3
Test Driven Design: 1

I spent ~12 hours pairing with DJ on fixing the broken spec harness, had the lowest number of failing specs (with the exception of Josh Cass), and had more tests than practically the whole cohort (with the exception of Ricki), and I still got terrible scores. Austen Tito gave me and Cass these same scores (2-3-3-3-1) despite us having the most complete projects - another student literally told his assessor that he had copy and pasted my tests, and he still got higher scores on TDD than I. About half the class had between 2 and 10 times as many failing specs as I and still got better scores on project completion. I really enjoyed this project and do not feel that my scores are reflective of the work I accomplished - the 4 students Austen graded had the 4 worst scores overall, despite Josh Cass and I having the most complete projects, having paired with DJ on the spec harness both in person and through Pull Requests, and having more test coverage than the majority of the class.

###Feedback to Me
----
Last module, some challenges that I encountered were trying to go too fast, not taking pomodoros, and not committing frequently enough. This module, I've attempted to slow down, and my peers seem to agree that I've improved in that area - my public speaking skills have improved a huge amount due to all the lightning talks I've given (I think it's like 10 or so now?). I also now take pomodoros on every project I work on, and I now have over 1000 commits (and I frequently use commit messages as notes in lessons for future reference).

###Community
----
On Friday, July 24th, I gave a live-coded, improvised lightning talk called 'Enumerator Playground'.
On the same day, I ran a student led session about reimplementing Enumerator and Enumerable.

On Friday, August 7th, I gave a live coded, improvised lightning talk called "Overthinking your first Ruby Class"
On the same day, I ran a mini student led session about creating Gems.
On the same day, I lead another mini session on workflow called the 10x Developer, about Shell/Vim/Heroku/Mac workflow.

On Friday, August 14th, I will give a lightning talk that is a modified version of my conference talk at Lone Star Ruby.

I began constructing lesson plans with Regis for a Go elective that we will teach every week next module on Friday - I found the lack of continuous electives to be a huge gap in the Friday schedule, as I rarely ever learned anything iteratively and mostly learned tiny things about diverse subjects. This elective is an attempt to build upon knowledge every week of a totally different language than Ruby.

I've paired with Matt and Alon (1507) on their Sales Engine, Lovisa (1503) with her blogger project, and just about everyone in my cohort on various projects.

###Side Projects
----
I built prototype SMS platform for Comunidades Unidas Peru, an NGO working to empower health care workers in the Peruvian Amazon.
I built a mocking gem (called Mock Lobster!) as a Mocha replacement, which I used in several of my projects that has ~2000 downloads.
I wrote a gem called rosetta-code - a simple web-scraper for rosettacode.org that currently has ~2000 downloads.
I reimplemented Enumerator and Enumerable (and gave a conference talk about it).
I wrote a bunch of FizzBuzz solutions and benchmarked them to test class vs. instance methods, conditionals vs. cases, etc.
I made a live chat app using the MEAN stack.
