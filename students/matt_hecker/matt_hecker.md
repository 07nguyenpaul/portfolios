# Matt Hecker - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

one of my goals was, and is, to work on my soft skills. To be able to listen, speak, learn and educate effectively and with empathy.

Going into the program. I felt I had an academic headstart, This turned out to be completely false but that thought informed my goals going into the program.

   This project was graded by Jeff. focused on separation of components in this one. Also spent alot of time figuring out how to not only crack but produce the original key without using brute force.
   Some notes from Jeff: 
   "Good job breaking up components
Some Ruby implementation needs refactoring"

## Community

### Getting Feedback

I've asked for feedback via google forms and the little feedback i got was very generic.

I asked other members of my cohort personally and I couldn't really write fast enough to quote.

Here are some key points I've heard that I need to work on.
#### Negative
* I move too fast, whether or not I am in the position of teaching something or pairing or just having a conversation I tend to move from subject to subject or context to context without the other person feeling like they have a say in the matter

* I interrupt people, on my side of things I'm getting really excited about a concept and in my own eagerness to offer what I think is helpful or relevant I sort of just blurt things out. On the other person's side of the story they are just in the middle of speaking and I sort of talk over them. I really need to work on this

#### Positive

* I move fast, both a positive and a negative. I can help people faster if I can pick up on their code faster.

* I am flexible, I can work around logistics such as scheduling problems and the like.

### Giving Feedback

I enjoyed and am enjoying the program so far. I feel like I am learning at a very rapid rate. Furthermore I feel like I am being pushed to learn the right things. As a sort of meta feedback I also like how responsive to feedback the instructors have been.

### Playing a Part

I haven't done that much to support the larger community but I never felt like I was in a position to. most support I have given has been to my cohort, they work really hard. I talk with students from other cohorts but I am at a loss of what I can do to help them.
