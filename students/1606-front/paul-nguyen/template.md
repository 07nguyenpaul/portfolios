# Paul Nguyen - M1 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?

I didn't have many goals for module 1. However, one of my main goals I felt I accomplish was learning the basics, and having a good foundation to build upon. I knew we were going to move fast in this program but I didn't expect everyone, including myself, to have a foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery in 6 weeks! When looking back I'm really proud of myself.

### End of Module Assessment

#### (Color Changer)

* [GitHub URL](http://07nguyenpaul.github.io/color-literate-enigma)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

This project was our first single day project. The goal for this project was to generate a random color, !=white, that changes the background color of the screen. It only required 2 buttons, one that randomizes the colors and one that reset the background color to white. The buttons had a unique specifications on styling. Not only did this project test us on our CSS but our JavaScript as well.

(evaluation comments) // Haven't receieved any comments on this project yet.

Functional: 3 - Application meets all of the layout expectations and has one key feature fully implemented with one key feature partially implemented OR meets all functional expectations and has partially implemented layout.

JS Style: 3 - Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

Workflow: 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

HTML: 3 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

CSS: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

## Team

### Projects

I have completed the following Team Projects in Module 1.

#### (Number Guesser)

* [GitHub URL](https://07nguyenpaul.github.io/number-guesser/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

This was our first team project. We were required to use our knowledge in HTML and JavaScript to design a game that generates a random number between a default range or a range set by the user. We added some complexities as the game progressed. If the user guesses the number correctly the game increases and decreases the range by 10 just to make it a little more difficult.

#### Feedback from Steve
* Good job on completing all three phases.
* Needs refactoring.

Functional: 4 - Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

JS Style: 3 - Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Feedback from Peter Springer
Paul and I worked together on number guesser. I found Paul to be easy to work with. He was able to navigate problems in an effective manner. We both seemed to get a little hung up on syntax but I think that is expected on our first project. I would be happy to work with Paul again in the future.

#### (Bookmark List)

* [GitHub URL](https://mjvalade.github.io/bookmark-list/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

In this project we mainly focused on testing our jquery skills. We created a program that receives 2 inputs, a title and URL. The code specifies that the user has to input a valid URL in order to save it to the list. The program has another feature that enables the user to highlight certain bookmarks and record whether it has been read or not. Also, it allows the user to remove bookmarks while updating the application that records read, unread, and total amount of bookmarks listed.  

#### Feedback from Steve
* Need to be refactored using jquery. There was a mixture of JavaScript and jQuery.
* Good job on completing phase four.
* Workflow on github looks great. Looks like you communicated well and created different branches while working.
* Need to indent and organize code for better readability.
* CSS looks great.

Functional: 4 - Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

JS Style: 2 - Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring.

Workflow: 3 - The developer makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application. There are no formatting issues in the code base.

HTML: 2.5 - Developer solves structural problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code and every tag and selector is doing.

  Developer writes effective HTML, but does not write semantically correct and clearly organized code. Application shows some effort to use semantically correct HTML, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear. There are many un-semantic tags and unnecessary selectors and it is not clear to the evaluator what a given section of code represents visually. Developer cannot speak to every line of code.

CSS: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS is doing.

##### Feedback from MaryJane Valade
Paul and I seemed to work very well together. We were able to organize our thoughts and talk through each aspect of the project before diving into writing code. He was very accommodating to my more restricted schedule for pairing up outside class hours.

#### (Idea Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://sikemausa.github.io/idea-box/)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

In this project we learned about keeping 'server' and 'client' as separate entities. We used JSON and localStorage to store and regenerate ideas inside localStorage. We created a code to hold ideas inside of an array of objects with four attributes: an unique id, title, body and quality ranking. We also enabled a feature that lets the user edit any idea and it would update to their localStorage until they removed it. That unique id is hard coded to that specific idea, and we used it to update any changes made to it's title, body, or ranking quality. It is also used to find and display any idea that user is trying to find using the search bar.

#### Feedback from Louisa
* No major bugs and user is able to navigate effectively.
* Good job on workflow. Looks like you guy communicated well with each other.
* Couple issues on CSS, tiny details to look it. Forgot to add meta name for mobile screen CSS.

Spec Adherence: 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

User Interface: 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

JS: 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Workflow: 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

##### Feedback from Mike Sausa
Paul was great to work with, he was awesome at taking initiative and getting features started, and was very effective in knowing when we were stuck an asking for help. Our workflow and GitHub had some room for improvement, but overall Paul was great to work with, and pushed us through some tough stretches.

#### (Snake)

* [GitHub URL](https://kccrs.github.io/Snakes)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

For game time we decided to make Snake. We used jquery, mocha, HTML, JavaScript and CSS. The goal was not only to design but test the implementations of our code. Everyone knows how the game works but there are several parts to designing the game. We first had top render a snake on a canvas and make it move. The next step was to generate food for the snake to eat, but generate it in different locations of the canvas that the snake does not occupy. Next we had to make the snake grow when the food is eaten. This was a the tricky part of the design because each segment of the snake has to follow the piece in front of it. If not, the snake wouldn't zig and zag. Lastly, we had to create code to end the game based on if the snake hits a wall or runs into itself.

##### Feedback from Casey Cross
Paul makes an excellent teammate. I worked with him on creating a snake game for the Game Time project.  He has a very serene and pleasant demeanor, even when he is incredibly frustrated.  Thus he served as a calming influence for me during my times of frustration.  I think our skills and strengths complement each other very well.  We also had a great balance in sharing the workload.  My only advice would be for Paul to take more Pomodoro breaks to clear his head when stuck on a problem for a length of time.  I would happily pair with Paul again in the future!

## Community

### Giving Feedback

##### Number Guesser: Peter Springer
Pete and I worked together to create our first project in Turing. We created a number guesser game. Pete was great partner with teaching his understanding of github. We found multiple bugs in our code and his problem solving skills are amazing. I would definitely recommend Pete as a partner and I would gladly work with him again on future projects.

##### Bookmark List: MaryJane Valade
MaryJane and I worked together to create our bookmark list program. Even though we had different availability, we discussed that in our DTR and resolved it by meeting in the mornings before class. MaryJane was very easy to work with and she implemented pseudo coding which made it easier to structure our code. I would be happy to work with her on future projects!

##### Idea Box: Mike Sausa
Mike and I worked together to create our Idea Box program. Mike was able to navigate problems in an effective manner. The only problems we had was with github. My only suggestion is to keep working with it because github has several tricks to work efficiently. I would happily work with Mike on future projects.

##### Snake: Casey Cross
Casey and I worked together to create our first game, SNAKE ON A PLANE! :snake::airplane: She taught me more things about github that I did not know. She has a great work ethic and organizes her work well by creating multiple branches on github. Casey has a great eye at spotting errors and resolving them in an effective manner. We worked efficiently together and I am proud of what we created. I can’t wait to see what we create next in the near future!
