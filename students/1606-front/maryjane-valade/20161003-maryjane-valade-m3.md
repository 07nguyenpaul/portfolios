-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

##### Specification Adherence
3 - The application includes all of the major functionality. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.

##### Determining the right tools for the job
4 - Developer selected appropriate libraries and frameworks to build the app and demonstrates complete understanding of how to use them

##### Following Documentation
3 - Developer was able to get the back-end running and successfully sent and received data from the server using the correct endpoints listed in the documentation. Needed some instructor guidance to implement them correctly.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

Personal Project

#### CO Kid Hikes

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/mjvalade/cokid-hikes)
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/self-directed-project.html)

I developed a website application to create hiking trails that are kid-friendly so users can keep track of trails they have done or want to do in the future. This project was basically an Idea Box but I also implemented various API calls. I found a user's geolocation and then used that to call a weather API to find the local weather. I also brought in the Google Maps API so that when a user makes a new trail they can drop a pin to note the trailhead's location.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

Two paired projects: Weather Tracker and Remember

#### Weather Tracker

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/mjvalade/weather-forecast)
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/weather-forecast.html)

The weather app project was the first time we paired in a group of three people rather than two so it was important to focus on workflow and code commits. This project forced us to learn a lot of things all at once between redux, API calls, routing, etc. First we had to find a user's geolocation and then use that to find the local weather. the focus of the app was allowing a user to create a list of pinned or favorite cities and getting the current and extended forecast for those cities. This was the first time we implemented Redux with React and had to learn how to organize all our actions in order to pass state from the main store.

**Scores:**  
Specification Adherence  
4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.  

Redux Architecture  
4 - Appropriate components are wrapped in connected Redux components. The Redux store contains all necessary application data and nothing more. All state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers.

Routing  
4: Application is a single page and uses the React Router to display appropriate components based on URL.

JS Style  
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Group can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

Testing  
3 - Project has a running test suite that tests multiple levels but fails to cover some features.

Workflow  
3 - The group makes a series of small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application and it is clear who was responsible for what features.

#### Remember

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/turingschool-projects/1606-remember-5)
* [Original Assignment] ()

This was our first chance working with the JS framework Ember. This project was structured in more of a real-world style with a focus on workflow by receiving and solving user stories, pushing code for PRs and code review before merging and moving on to the next issue. Our system of working together until we felt comfortable tackling issues on our own was productive and helped us learn Ember better. Then we were able to move at a faster pace by dividing issues and reviewing together before pushing up for instructor review.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Project 1: Weather App (Pete)  
I enjoyed working on the weather app project with you. You always put things in perspective and are able to take the long view. When I got ahead of myself and came to you for help, you were able to slow me down to think about the first small thing I was trying to accomplish rather than my big problem.

Project 1: Weather App (Jeff)  
It was nice to work with you again on the weather app. This project forced us to learn a lot of things all at once between redux, API calls, routing, etc. Once you figured out how to make redux work I appreciated that you tried to explain it to us rather than just breaking apart the project to work on our own elements. Taking redux on your shoulders when we were struggling helped Pete and I work on the rest of the project.

Project 2: Ember Remember (Kirsten)  
I enjoyed working with you on learning a brand new framework in Ember. I feel like our system of working together until we felt comfortable tackling issues on our own was productive and helped us learn Ember better. The best thing I gained from working with you is that whenever i wanted to go ask for help you wouldnâ€™t let me because you thought we could figure it out ourselves - and you were usually right. This has really helped me with my personal project.

### Being a Community Member

From Susi Irwin:  
I am so fortunate to have gotten to know MaryJane over the past 3 modules at Turing and cannot say enough amazing things about her. She is the epitome of what Turing strives for in its developers: strong, courageous, talented, passionate. She balances school while raising two children who adore her. She manages to assist other students in the Front End Program, offer guidance to any Back End students who reach out as well. She is hard working and it is extremely apparent how dedicated she is to success. She attends the Joan Clarke Society Tuesday meetings regularly and is always around for a chat if I need. Such a pleasure to be a part of her community.
