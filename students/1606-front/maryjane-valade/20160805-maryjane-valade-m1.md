# MaryJane Valade - M1 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into Turing I knew that I would learn about HTML, CSS, and Javascript so that I could begin to make web applications. I had some familiarity with HTML and CSS from many years ago but did not know what to expect with Javascript and come to find out jQuery goes along with JS. I did not have any specific goals beyond learning how to be in school again, how to be successful in the program, and to keep my mind open to all the new information I knew was to come.

As the weeks went on I made an effort to apply my design skills towards a high level of styling projects when applicable. I also became determined to learn not only the concepts behind JS but how to write this new language. I am becoming more proficient but still feel that I have a long way to go.

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Work

I completed one Individual project this module and have an ongoing portfolio website.

#### Portfolio

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/mjvalade/portfolio)
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

A personal portfolio website I will be working on throughout the 7 months at Turing. This website will be an example of my coding and styling skills but it will also be a showcase for the many projects I have completed while in school. This website will be used to market myself during my job search.

## Team

### Projects

We completed four paired projects this Module.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/mjvalade/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

The goal of this project was to build a game where the user must guess a random number between 1 and 100.

Scores:
Functional: 3
JS Style: 2.5


#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/mjvalade/bookmark-list)
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

After learning some of the basics of jQuery, the goal of this project was to build a small online application that let users input websites they liked to create a bookmark list.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/mjvalade/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

Using Javascript, jQuery, localStorage, and good UX, we built a simple application for recording and archiving a user's ideas (good and bad alike).

(evaluation comments)

Scores: (Steve)

Spec Adherence: 3 - The application consists of one page with all of the major functionality being provided by jQuery. No approach was taken that is counter to the spirit of the project and its learning goals. There are no features missing from above that make the application feel incomplete or hard to use.
User Interface

User Interface: 3 - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.
JavaScript Style

JS: 3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.
Workflow

Workflow: 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.


#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL] ()
* [Original Assignment] (http://frontend.turing.io/projects/game-time.html)

The goal of this project was to use all the skills we've learned so far to build a simple game that was playable and looked good in the browser.
My partner and I used the Google Chrome dinosaur game as inspiration to create Surf's Up. Players manipulate a surfer with the spacebar to jump over rocks.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Project 1 feedback (Madison, Number Guesser):
Madison is a very supportive teammate. We were learning how to do a Turing project at the same time as trying to figure out the current project so there was a large learning curve but I think we weathered it well together. She made a great attempt to stay organized and keep us on track. Sometimes she jumped around before finishing a task but usually recognized it and tried to come back to original task.


Project 2 feedback (Paul, Linked List):
Paul and I seemed to work very well together. We were able to organize our thoughts and talk through each aspect of the project before diving into writing code. He was very accommodating to my more restricted schedule for pairing up outside class hours.


Project 3 feedback (Madison, Ideabox):
As our second project together I felt that we worked really well as a team. We were much better at breaking the project up into tasks and Madisonâ€™s use of a Trello board was very helpful. Her grasp of JavaScript and making attempts at trouble-shooting when we ran into problems helped us when we got stuck. I think we got more comfortable asking for help sooner than on the last project but we were also able to ask better questions and be more directed in what exactly we needed help doing.

Project 4 feedback (Blake, Game Time):

### Being a Community Member

From Paul:
MaryJane and I worked together to create our bookmark list program. Even though we had different availability, we discussed that in our DTR and resolved it by meeting in the mornings before class. MaryJane was very easy to work with and she implemented pseudo coding which made it easier to structure our code. I would be happy to work with her on future projects!

From Madison:
MaryJane it was such a great experience getting the opportunity to grow with you. I felt that our progression between the two projects exemplified our learning throughout Turing. We started out with a somewhat rocky as we both absorbed the abundance of information presented to us in the initial weeks at Turing. We pulled through our first project and continued to improve thereafter. I am thankful that I got to experience your growth in project management, development and confidence. I am not only admirable of your CSS skills but also your persistence to understand complex topics. I hope that you continue to cultivate your confidence in coding and leadership through future projects. I felt that we balanced each other well and helped to strengthen the skills of one another brought to the table.

### Playing a Part

- I have been to many of the Joan Clarke Society morning coffees and enjoy meeting women from the various Mods and alumni. It has been interesting getting to know the other women and what they are working on. In turn they have been really interested to hear what the FE program is like and what we are working on.

- I am a part of the #turingmoms Slack channel and that has been a big help as I navigate through this first Mod. Sometimes I deliberately avoid mentioning my kids to classmates because I don't want to only be seen as a mom or have people think I want any exceptions made for me, but in this group I can be free to vent with women who understand the difficulties. Now that I have one Mod under my belt I am happy to share how my family makes it work with fellow moms and potential students.

- I try to help my classmates with questions whenever I can and I always end up learning something at the same time.
