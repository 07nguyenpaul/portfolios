### Areas of Emphasis

This module I focused my time and energy into better understanding some of the more complicated aspects of Javascript. I effectively utilized my time to explore more adventurous designs and some explorations into ES6. I cemented my foundational learnings from mod one and began to approach thinking about code differently while working with React. Near the end of the module I started to get comfortable with both React and SCSS. I began to feel like a true developer and I am excited to start taking on more ambitious projects going forward.

**Scores**
* Evaluator: Brenna
  - Notes: Submit button is disabled but not visibly different

* Specification Adherence
  - 4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

  - 3: Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of CSS/Sass is doing.

* JavaScript Style
  - 3 - Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

* Testing  
  - Notes:
  - 16 Passing tests
  - Tests are written to follow spec adherance
  - Limited unit tests - some skipped

  - 3 - Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features. All functionality is covered by tests. The application makes some use of feature testing.

* Workflow  
  - Notes: 67 Commits
  - 4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

* Code Sanitation  
  - The output from a code sanitizer (either JSHint or ESLint) shows…
  - 3 - Five or fewer complaints  

* Design
  - 4 - The application is visually appealing and shows thoughtful and effective use of typography, color, and layout. The application looks professional, with visuals enhancing the user’s experience. The evaluator has very few recommended changes.

## Community

This module I continued my involvement in the community by working with SAB to run events and maintain a good cohort vibe. I actively participated in events on a weekly basis often bringing fellow students along to different meetups and helping expose them to the community. I also spent time every week working with other students and helping them with their projects. It was rewarding and I am happy with my involvement in the community this mod.

### Giving Feedback

My feedback to my partners is as follows:

**Feedback**
>Kyle: Chatroom -
  Kyle, it was great to have the opportunity to work with you again this mod. I know we had both given each other feedback from last mod, and I really feel that this was an even better and smoother project then last time. You are diligent about managing the process and keeping us on track on Waffle.io. I know that I had suggested that you let me drive a bit more this time and I appreciate you taking that to heart. All in all I think it was a great project and I had a great time working with you.

**Feedback**
>David: Pomodoro -
  David, I really learned a lot from working with you and had a lot of fun. It was nice to be in a project environment where there was no clashing. I felt like we sailed through the project and you did a great job explaining some of the time concepts that I found difficult to understand at first. I do not have much critical feedback because it went well. I think in the future, stopping and refactoring is an important step that we could have spent a bit more time on. All in all, great working with you.

**Feedback**
>Madison: Gains -
  Madison, I am so glad we had the opportunity to work together. You are an absolute riot and an idea machine! You have an in-depth way of looking into the bigger picture and making large scale changes that I find difficult to do myself. I think that is a great skill to have and it paid off in our project. Your SCSS work was awesome and made it easy form me to work with the file you created. Sometimes we got in over our heads with big changes that I had a difficult time helping you with because we were changing so much. I think you are definitely capable of doing that, but it occasionally made it hard for me to help because I didn’t know what was specifically wrong. Thanks for being a great partner and I can’t wait to work more on the app!

**Feedback**
> Mike: Chatroom 2 and Gains -
  Mike, you are a great partner who I have thoroughly enjoyed working with through the last two projects. I have found that you speak up right when I am not understanding something and are great at helping solve difficult problems. I think you are great group mediator and have a special skill when it comes to lightening the mood. In terms of advice, I would say to keep on working through the javascript and improving. You’re seem to be doing a great job and I really appreciated having you as a partner.
