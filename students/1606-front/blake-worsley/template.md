### Areas of Emphasis

This module, my goal was to establish a foundation of knowlege around javascript, css and html. I wanted to get a grasp of the basics and take the time to go back over my projects and fully understand what I was working on. I also wanted to get involved in the community and develop an understanding of what was required to be successful in this industry.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)
Pete and I ended up with a solid ideabox concept when we presented. Pete was very good about taking the time to explain concepts he had undertaken and completed and was willing to do whatever it took to output an excellent finished project. I do think we both came into the project with ambitions to learn above all else and I feel like we had conflicting ideology of what to do next at different points throughout the project. Looking back, I think if we created a more concrete plan of how we wanted to proceed through some of the complicated parts of the project, we would have been able to collaborate more effectively during pairing sessions. Otherwise Pete was great to work with and I am glad I had him on this project.

It was a pleasure working with Jeff on the number guesser project. Jeff clearly has a firm grasp on the material and was very strong in the javascript concepts even being the first time that we had worked with them. I really don’t have much critical feedback to give Jeff. I feel that he may have gone ahead a bit on his own for some of the final aspects of the project but at the time we had split up some of the work so it is to be expected. It was great working with him and I look forward to doing so in the future.

Had a great time working with you on linked list. We had a great opportunity to work through a difficult project together. We successfully delivered a final project and learned how to navigate git well in the process. The only critique I would give is that at times I would have liked to have a bit more control over what was happening. In the future I think taking turns switching who controls the flow when pairing will be beneficial. Thanks again though for everything and I look forward to working with you soon!

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)
Blake and I worked together on ideabox. The project was a success and I feel that we were able to collaborate very effectively. At times throughout the project Blake seemed highly stressed. I think this may have been from not fully understanding some syntax(for loops?). I think as Blake gets more comfortable using documentation the unknown will become less stressful and possibly even a little fun.

It was great working with Blake and I’m really glad we were partnered up for the first project.  We worked really well together and were able to map out and work through the problems together.  Blake also has some great design chops and really made our project stand out.  The only actionable feedback is that we were both eager to get code on the screen which didn’t work out as well as the times when we stopped and mapped out/pseudo-coded the problem we were trying to solve and what steps we needed to take to solve it.  Once we started doing that things went a lot smoother and I think we can both keep that in mind on future projects.   I look forward to working with Blake on other projects in future modules!

Really enjoyed working with you on this project. From beginning to end we both worked hard to not only deliver a great final product but to learn along the way. I don’t feel like we strayed at all from our DTR. Additionally, I feel like linked list was the project where we struggled through Git & Github and came out making great strides in our understanding of how to use it. I did notice that after trying something only a few times you’d get pretty agitated & stressed that it wasn’t working. I think keeping a level head & being aware of when a big problem needs to be broken down into smaller ones will pay large dividends for you over your career as a developer. Looking forward to working with you again!




### Playing a Part

Early in my time here at turing, I was invited to be a part of the Student Advisory Board and actively led and engaged our cohort in our weekly group retros. I conducted surveys and sat in on meetings
