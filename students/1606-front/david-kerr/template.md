# David Kerr - M1 - FE Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to learn as much as I could during these first 6 weeks.  I had no idea who to expect, so it was difficult for me to even conceptualize the pace or scope of this class.  The rough outline for each module is intimidating, so I guess my only hope was to leave module 1 looking at that outline and feeling comfortable with each of the subjects on the list.

### Work

Our only individual work has been the color-changer project, which was an afternoon project without complex requirements.  I finished this project and added localStorage, which we had just learned, to try and apply a new concept outside of the bounds of what was expected.  I have a tendency to force my way through problems rather than stopping and rethinking a situation when I hit a wall, so having a partner forces me to slow down and think.  This was not an issue for the color changer project, but I could see this being a concern with future solo projects.

#### Random-Color-Generator

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kerrd89/literate-engine)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/color-changer.html)

Background generates a random color and stores that color in local storage.  Refreshing returns to most recent background color.  I used JavaScript for this project but it could have also have been done using JQuery.

I received no feedback aside from the scores below on this project.

#### Personal-Porfolio

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kerrd89/personal-page)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/portfolio-first-draft.html)

Created a personal page to house my Turing projects and serve as a jumping off point for our personal brand leaving Turing.  The finer points of website design are clearly still out of my personal grasp, but the framework is in place. My idea was to make the homepage a conduit for my social media activity leveraging APIs.  This is blank now, but my hope is that as we add tools we can apply them to our personal sites and make them standalone examples of the technologies which I am proficient in.

I received feedback about pulling colors out of a key image and using those colors as a theme for the site.

### Projects

Below are my group projects from module-1.  Looking back on these projects, the progression serves as a testament to the incredible pace of this class.  How quickly we traveled from Number-Guesser to Game-time is shocking.  These projects all seemed daunting at the kickoff, but through working in pairs, talking through issues, and using each partners incomplete skills-et to piece together the whole puzzle none caused too much stress.

#### Number-Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kerrd89/number-guesser)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Made a basic number guessing game using vanilla Javascript.  Added features are user defined minimum and maximum and automatically increasing difficulty on successful guesses.

Steve mentioned that the project had room for refactoring.

Functional - 4
JS - 2.5

From Ben - Although this was our first pairing project, and we had all barely known each other for a week, I felt that David and I worked very well together. While we got the project to work fairly quickly, our main errors lied in refactoring. Throughout the project, David was great to work with. He was very quick to pick up the concepts and “make the thing do the thing.” In addition, any time I had an trouble understanding where we were going or what we were doing, David was patient and made sure he explained the concept to the best of his ability.

If there was anything that I’d say you could work on, it would just be to continue to work on explaining the concepts at hand. Since it was our first project, I’m sure you’ve gotten better at this already, but you really are insanely smart and adept at picking up these concepts, so if you can eventually explain the concepts at that same level then you’ll be absolutely killing it.

#### (Linked-List)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kerrd89/crispy-broccolist)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Made a basic Linked-List of bookmarks using JQuery.  Bookmarks could be added, deleted, and marked 'read'.  

From Louisa: CSS styling left something to be desired (designed off the name)
From Julian:Minor refactoring but the logic is strong and fairly concise

From Mike: Hey David - great working with you, it was clear you knew your stuff, and your communication was spot on. I definitely agree that we could have utilized our time to push the envelope, and I feel that our workflow (github) could have been better. Other than that, everything was awesome!

#### (Idea-Box)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kerrd89/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

As part of introduction to object oriented programming and local storage, created a list of ideas maintained using local storage.  Ideas could be removed, added, and edited.  The ideas had qualities which could be upgraded or downgraded accordingly.  Styling was provided in the assignment but flexbox was used whenever possible.  We added a filter by quality of idea as well to extend the project.

From Steve: Make sure variables aren't declared globally and whenever possible make functions methods on objects

David is a great person to be paired with on a project. He is a prolific coder who lands on solutions quickly, and pulls his team along with energy and gusto. He communicated his schedule clearly, and helped us keep on task by managing our Trello board. At times it was hard to keep up and feel like I was matching his contributions to our code base, but this isn’t necessarily a bad thing when operating on a deadline . I look forward to working with him again in the future.

#### (Game-time)

(Recreated TRON video game using vanilla javascript and canvas drawing)

### Giving Feedback

To Ben on Number-Guesser: Based on the limited information we had available, I feel like we made that project as easy as possible.  I think all points of reflection come back to refactoring (i.e our feedback on the problem) which at this point is moot since we knew 5% of what we know now.  You felt you were struggling or behind in the moment if I recall, but made sure that you were comfortable with everything in that project before moving forward which I thought was a great habit to get into.  Something I will definitely mirror in future projects.

To Mike Sausa on Linked-List: Really enjoyed working with you.  From an interaction standpoint I feel like we were consistently on the same page, communicating through issues, and focusing on what matters.  As far as what we could improve, we could have focused our excess time on pushing the envelope more so than we did(but that would have sacrificed the finer design elements we nailed).

To Casey Metz on Idea-Box: Really enjoyed working with you.  I think you do a great job of listening which makes communication over issues/working through issues really simple.  Our workflow was limited because we were able to complete the project in person, but based on that limited experience then only constructive feedback I could give was that we could have done a better job of refactor and figuring out the most optimal path.(but that was due to my music festival, and I really appreciated your flexibility around that schedule)

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

I think I was a helpful and active classmate.  I am quick to ask questions when I am confused and willing to stop and help others when they are confused.

I attempted to, with Peter, run the Accessibility posse but we came up short with busy schedules and a lack of direction.  I attended all events to meet and engage with the backend and helped Beth run a p5 student led session several weeks ago when she was trying to do an into into making art with code (the day after we did our p5 tutorial).  I would like to make the engagement with the community more meaningful going forward.
