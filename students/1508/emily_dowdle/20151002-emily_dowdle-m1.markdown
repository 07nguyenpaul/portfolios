### Your Mission

<!-- Above all else, I came to Turing to learn. My goal for the first module was to overcome the hurdles of self-doubt and become familiar with basic programming.  -->

### End of Module Assessment

**Challenge: Multiplier**

Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

#### Notes:

* Got a challenging one - did well with collaboration and adapting when challenged.
* Small issue with conceptual syntax with ruby. Could have just been nerves. - Multi-line blocks.
* Needs to improve with workflow.
* Very solid with enumerables.

#### Scores:

* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 4
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 4


### Attendance

I was absent for the afternoon of Wednesday, August 26 due to an illness.

### Projects

Below is a list of all of my projects and assessment scores from Module 1.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emilydowdle/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

**Encryption/decryption machine.** Emphasis on breaking program into logical components, TDD and enumerable techniques. Required to build a key generator and date offset, encrypt a message using a 4-digit rotation, decrypt the message using a pre-determined key and crack an encrypted message without the key.

Assessed By: Mike Dao

#### Notes:

* Application was well tested, covered some edge cases, but was weak in unit testing.
* Some tests were skipped, and one test hung.
* Code was well written using the model of sending messages as opposed to manipulating
instance variables.
* Some minor opportunities to refactor.
* Some complicated enumerable using methods that used #each and #each_with_index
could be refactored to take advantage of best-use enumerables.
* Encrypt/Decrypt can be refactored to use the same class, as well as a portion of
the crack method.

#### Scores:

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4


#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emilydowdle/linked_list)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

**Linked list of Jungle Beats** Project emphasized understanding of linked lists through iteration and/or recursion. Program played beats on the command line and included features like append, prepend, insert, pop and find.

Assessed By: Mike Dao

#### Notes:

Notes:

* 27 tests, all passing
* Good breaking out of code to methods.
* Some unnecessary variables
* Minor refactoring necessary
* Would like to have seen the non linked list stuff pulled out to a separate class

#### Scores:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 4
* Looping or Recursion: 4


#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/emilydowdle/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

**Markdown to HTML parsing program.** One week assignment. Emphasis on TTD, enumerable techniques, reading/writing files and architecting a program into logical components.

Assessed By: Mike Dao

#### Notes:

* Number of failing tests
* File IO should be broken out to its own class.
* Could use some better unit tests with edge cases and sad path tests

#### Scores:

* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 4
* Test Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3


#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emilydowdle/turing/tree/master/first_module/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/mastermind.html)

**Command line code-cracking game.**

Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

#### Scores:

* Fundamental Ruby and Style - 2
* Enumerable & Collections - 4
* REPL Interface and Game Functionality - 3
* Breaking Logic into Components - 2


## Community

### Giving Feedback

Jill Donohue: "Jill is an excellent communicator whose strength is knowing how to diplomatically convey difficult topics. I believe Jill has the potential to be an excellent developer. Her greatest challenge is her own self-doubt. If she devoted the energy she spends doubting her abilities to programming, she would quickly outpace many of the students around her. Jill cares deeply about her peers and works tirelessly to help those around her work through challenges, allowing them to achieve more than they would have alone. I struggle to think and speak at the same time — especially about programming — and in the week we worked together, Jill never rushed or interrupted me. I am a better developer because I have worked with her."

Aaron Careaga: "Pair programming with Aaron lacked many of the roadblocks I’ve experienced with other pairs. We decided to take five minutes to individually experiment with ideas in IRB and then came together to recursively create a custom method equal to .flatten. Aaron’s positive attitude made him a joy to work with and his logical insights filled the gaps in my own thinking, allowing us to efficiently develop a solution."

### Being a Community Member

“**Emily’s greatest strength is her ability to come across problems and attack them until she finds a solution.** I was astonished by her ability to persevere even during the most frustrating parts of Enigma. She eloquently writes code and translates this skill into her project design seamlessly. The only time I ever witnessed her stumble was explaining her code to me as she was used to fluidly incorporating it into her file. **Wonderful person to work with who cares not only for the project, but also for her partner’s well-being.**" --Jill Donohue

"I really enjoyed pairing with Emily. **She communicates effectively and maintains a positive attitude while working on problems.** We were able to get on the same page and talk through hurdles as encountered. Her logical reasoning helped me better understand the structure of our code and refactor methods once  functional. I hope to pair together again on future projects." --Aaron Careaga

### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Attended Boulder Ruby Meetup on September 16, 2015 to see Andrew Carmer speak.
* Regularly attended Joan Clarke Society morning coffee meetups.
* Joined 3 Lovelace posse lunches.
* Meet with Rolen Le every Wednesday evening for an hour.
* Provide moral support/technical advice when needed.
