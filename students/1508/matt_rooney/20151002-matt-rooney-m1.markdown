## Individual

### Your Mission

In Module 1, I set out to build a solid foundation in Ruby and programming concepts. I've seen firsthand the pitfalls of being self-taught and came here intending to gain a thorough understanding of the many facets of Ruby programming. 

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

Overall pretty clean code. Tests could be a little more descriptive and investigative. Overuse of instance variables. Had SRP classes, but did not follow corresponding file structure. Had runner files.
