# Matt Rooney - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

In Module 1, I set out to build a solid foundation in Ruby and programming concepts. I've seen firsthand the pitfalls of being self-taught and came here intending to gain a thorough understanding of the many facets of Ruby programming.

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

#### Jungle Beats

I feel like I really hit my stride with this project.

Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
Looping or Recursion: 4

Overall pretty clean code. Tests could be a little more descriptive and investigative. Overuse of instance variables. Had SRP classes, but did not follow corresponding file structure. Had runner files. - Andrew

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I try to always respond to my fellow students, staff and instructors with positivity. It's easy (maybe unavoidable) to feel overwhelmed at some point in module 1, but feeling overwhelmed never seems to help. I've found that responding to my classmates questions and doubts with positivity and confidence actually helps with my confidence in my own programming abilities.

I gave feedback to Edgar Duran and Aaron Careaga, who were my partners on group projects.

I also gave the following shout-outs in the September 15th Turing Posse Post: "Shout out to Travis (1507) for dropping helpful little bits of knowledge and strategy throughout the week and Jhun for his contagious enthusiasm."

### Being a Community Member

I really enjoyed partnering with Matt on our final project. The scale and depth of the challenge pushed both of us beyond our comfort zones and levels of knowledge. Matt carries a positive attitude and logical reasoning ability that helped us talk through road blocks and overcome the numerous hurdles we encountered. I hope to pair with Matt again on future projects.

### Playing a Part

Joined the 1510 Party Planning Committee and will be attending the 1510 Intro Workshop on Oct. 8th.
Joined the Music slack channel and hope to contribute to the podcast and the podcast's theme song in the coming weeks.
Present and happy to collaborate on daily warmups.
