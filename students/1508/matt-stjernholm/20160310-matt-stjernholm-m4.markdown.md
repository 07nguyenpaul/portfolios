# Matt Stjernholm - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into module 4, I wanted to graduate Turing feeling confident in my ability to work with any type of Rails or Node web app.
As it turned out, things really start to click down the strecth and I can say that I feel more than prepared to go out into the world
and start writing code professionally.  

### End of Module Assessment

- Passed module 4 without needing to take the final assessment.

### Work

While I loved the projects in module 3, I think I enjoyed -- and am more proud of -- the apps that we were able to build in module 4.
It was amazing to see how quickly you can pick up a new language once you already know one, and I was shoked at the interesting things you can do with just a little JavaScript under your belt.

Had a great time with my partners (Matt Rooney & Emily Dowdle) for the two team Game Time projects.  Felt like we worked well together and were able to make our own unique contributions to the projects.
