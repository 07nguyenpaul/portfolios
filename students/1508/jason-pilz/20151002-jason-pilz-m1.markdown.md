# Jason Pilz - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Going into this module, I set out to gain a solid understanding and familiarity with a new language (Ruby) that I can build upon, which I feel I accomplished. I also had a goal to improve my keyboard / typing speed as well, of which I have improved from 30wpm (only alpha characters) to average 45wpm (including special characters). My ability to work and pair efficiently with another person was something I was nervous to do, and after working on, and completing our final project, I am quite comfortable with the benefits of this work strategy. I am looking forward to building on the foundation created during this module going forward.

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Attendance

I have not missed any days of the module. Also never showed up late or
left early.

### Work

My skills/knowledge improved by working on the following projects as part of echo group this module:

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonpilz/SortingSuite.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/sorting-suite.git)

Sorting algorithms are one of the common domains for studying Computer Science data structures and algorithms.
In this project, you are challenged to implement three fundamental sorting algorithms.

##### Personal Notes:
* This was our first solo project, and was a challenging test of my logical thinking abilities. I spent approx. 18hrs to create solutions for bubble and insertion sort, and was unable to solve merge sort before the due date. I focused my effort on refining my two solutions for improved ruby style / clarity versus getting merge sort functional. I have enjoyed going through the 'blowing bubbles' exercises with Josh Cheek which have further improved my understanding of these sorting algorithms.

Assessed by: Sean Griffin

##### Notes
* Merge sort does not work
* Names are better than "it sorts the array" but there's room for improve
* Uses rubocop :+1: :+1: :+1:
* On github, proper file names

##### Scores
* Functional Expectations: 2
* Testing: 3.5
* Ruby Style: 3
* Organization: 4

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonpilz/LinkedList.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

Linked Lists are one of the most fundamental Computer Science data structures. A Linked List models a collection of data as a series of "nodes" which link to one another in a chain.

Assessed by: Sean Griffin

##### Notes
* Two base expectations missing
* Test coverage is pretty OK, more edge cases would have been nice to see. Spent
  time talking about stylistic nitpicks
* Some logic was moved to the node, but there was almost no code re-use within
  the list itself
* Many long methods, code that required comments. Could be better factored
* Showed understanding of looping, but I wouldn't call it "excellent"

##### Scores
* Functional Expectations: 1
* Testing: 3
* Encapsulation: 2
* Ruby Style: 2
* Looping or Recursion: 3

#### Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonpilz/BinarySearchTree)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

A binary search tree is a fundamental data structure useful for organizing large sets of data.
A binary tree is built from nodes. Each node has:

* A) An element of data
* B) A link to the left. All nodes to the left have data elements less/lower than this node's data element.
* C) A link to the right. All nodes to the right have data elementes more/greater than this node's data element.

Assessed by: Josh Cheek

##### Notes
* Tests all pass
* The naming of these test is really good (describes the behaviour)
* Push behaviour down into the node, life will be simpler :)

##### Scores
* Functional Expectations: 3
* Testing: 4
* Encapsulation: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Enumerable and Collections: 3

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonpilz/NightWriter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon's army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille's development of his Braille tactile writing system.
In this project we'll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.

Assessed by: Josh Cheek

##### Notes
* Indent lines that continue the previous line's expression to help the reader
* Tests all pass
* Good coverage
* Good naming

##### Scores
* Functional Expectations: 3-
* Testing: 4
* Encapsulation: 3
* Ruby Style: 3


## Team

### Projects

The only team project this module was Headcount, which was a team effort, paired with Pat Wey.

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jasonpilz/Headcount.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Federal and state governments publish a huge amount of data. You can find a large collection of it on Data.gov -- everything from land surveys to pollution to census data.

As programmers, we can use those data sets to ask and answer questions. Starting with CSV data we will:
* build a "Data Access Layer" which allows us to query/search the underlying data
* build a "Relationships Layer" which creates connections between related data
* build an "Analysis Layer" which uses the data and relationships to draw conclusions
* We'll build upon a dataset centered around schools in Colorado provided by the Annie E. Casey foundation.

Assessed by: Josh Cheek

##### Evaluation Comments
* Passes everything presently in the test harness (analysis up through the cursor of consensus)
* Generally looks good
* Paying the cost to get the tests to run quickly is nearly always a worthwhile investment, because of the shocking speed boost to development, that you get when you can instantly say "and yes, my shit still works". So even if it takes a long time, it nearly always pays off.
* Test harness passes
* Their tests all pass (87 examples, 35s)
* Names make sense (describe the behaviour)
* Choose names that allow you to think about what the object's responsibility is, not about the nuances of which object is currently fulfilling that responsibility. ie a name like data_source instead of parser
* The data that comes back from the data source should be formatted in whatever way your code wants it to be... and the way you want it to be is not going to be the way that the CSV happened to be. You can figure out what you want by writing those tests before you parse the CSVs, or by being really good at pretending you don't know what the CSVs look like, and saying "what would make this trivially easy to answer?" and probably you wind up with some very simple objects that are just decorated hashes.

##### Scores
* Functional Expectations: 4
* Testing: 3.5
* Encapsulation: 3
* Ruby Style: 3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Pat Wey
* This module I have had the pleasure to work on not just 1, but 2 paired projects with Pat. His technical skills are superior to my own, so I have been able to learn and increase my skill by working with him. He is always open to different opinions or approaches, which makes collaboration very easy and enjoyable. I have observed numerous cohort-mates ask Pat for assistance on various projects, and he is always willing and able to help.

Ryan Johnson
* Ryan has been very open and helpful throughout this module. He has been willing to collaborate and give opinions when asked, and has consistently been a positive person in our cohort. I have enjoyed each opportunity to work with Ryan that I have had.

Matt Stjernholm
* Working with Matt during this module has been a pleasure. His motivation and dedication inspires me to continue to push when feeling tired or discouraged. I have improved my programming and pairing skills this module with Matt’s help. I have observed Matt being willing and excited to help all cohort-mates whenever he is given the opportunity.

### Being a Community Member

Ryan Johnson
* Jason has truly been helpful during this module. He has always been available when I needed help or guidance. When I was not able to make it to class due to my son being sick, he recorded the class for me and gave me a full recap of what I missed. He is a person of integrity who is always willing to go the extra mile to help his fellow classmates.

Matt Stjernholm
* Jason consistently pushed me to be a better student throughout Module 1.  His positive outlook and “you can do it” attitude is a big reason why I stuck around in the Echo group — which I’m extremely grateful for.  On top of that, Jason showed me countless keybinding shortcuts, Atom add-ons, and tricks that streamlined my workflow and made me more efficient.  Can’t imagine where I’d be without Jason, and I look forward to having him around next module!

### Playing a Part

* Researched and was in contact with Bohemian Coding to determine a process for Turing to receive 50% student/teacher discount on Sketch3. Wrote up a Gist outlining the procedure and posted it for the school community.
