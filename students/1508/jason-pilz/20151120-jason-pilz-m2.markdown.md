(Intro)

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/amcrawford/traffic-spy-skeleton.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

For this project, I worked with Amber and Jill. We spent 100% of the time paired on the basic functionality of the app. We then split off and Jill & Amber worked on bootstrapping and creating partials, while I completed the campaigns extensions. I learned a lot from this project, especially routing and sqlite database structuring. I also valued the increase in my soft skills while working with these 2 talented ladies.

##### Evaluation Comments

* Full functionality + two extensions; good use of parser objects; good separation of web and business logic; would like to see fewer instance variables sent to views

##### Scores
* Functional Expectations: 4
* TestDriven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Components: 3.5
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3.5
* View Layer: 3.5
