# (John Slota) - (M3) Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My mission is to learn as much as I can during my time at Turing so that I can obtain gainful employment in the crypto currrency fields to help better the world.

### Attendance
I missed one day of school to attend my first Green Bay Packers Football game December 11th.

### Work
Below are the projects I worked on this module
(Intro)

#### (Rails Engine)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/slotaj/rails-engine)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md]

(Description)
Rails Engine was a project where we took in data from Sales Engine and built our own API to access the data.

(Scores)
1. completion: 3
2. test-driven-development: 3
3. code-quality: 3
4. api-design: 3
5. queries: 3

#### (API Curious)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/slotaj/twitter)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md]

(Description)
API Curious was a project where I built a mock Twitter app that uses the Twitter Gem to pull real information from Twitter and allows the user to update their feed real time.

(Scores)
Feature Delivery

1. Completion: 3 Developer delivered all planned features.
2. Organization: 3 Developer used a project management tool to keep their project organized.

Technical Quality

1. Test-Driven Development: 3 Project demonstrates high test coverage (>80%), tests at feature and unit levels, but relies on external services

2. Code Quality: 3 Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
Product Experience

1. User Experience: 3 The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality

(Evaluation Comments)
  - design was bare and not great but UI was intuitive

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (The Pivot)

* [GitHub URL](github.com/emilydowdle/the_pivot)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md]

(Discription)
The goal of this project was to take our Slota Chips app and refactor it into a different store with a team.

(Scores)

Product and Feature Delivery
  1. Completion: 2.5 ** talk to josh
  2. Organization: 4
  3. User Experience: 3

Technical Quality
  1. Test-Driven Development: 3+: Project shows adequate testing (90% - 95% coverage).
  2. Code Quality: 3+: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.

  Assessed By: Andrew and Josh M.

(Evaluation Comments)
  - Good UI. Some really great additional features. App failed to update ticket status. Also a minor error in Platform Admin functionality.

  - Some gaps in testing. Some code is executing but not providing or testing the actual business value.
  Most are solid and when adjusting during the to make them more robust they still passed.
  Took good risks and went above and beyond expectations without the code quality suffering.

#### (Trelora Hack)

(Discription)
  For my personal project I was able to team up with Tyler Komoroske and build a sweet hack project that implemented NokoGiri.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I always try to give and receive feedback to others as much as possible and try to listen to my peers and teachers to improve myself.

### Being a Community Member

"John was a great guy to work with.  At times the group had a little too much stress and John was the balancing factor.  He was always in a positive mood and calm which can be a really big deal when woking in a stressful environment.  His code was solid and I really enjoyed working with him." - Justin Pease

"When I first started working with John, I mistook his care-free nature for a lack of work ethic. ​*I was wrong.*​ When focused, John is a highly capable programmer. He dives in and gets the job done. His knowledge of the original code base and work on the cart/shopping functionality were critical to our success." - Emily Dowdle

"Slota was an awesome teammate to have during this project. He consistently showed a willingness to work hard and get things done, even if it meant losing a little bit of sleep. He was also extremely flexible as far as when he was available to work, which  made it very easy to pair on this project. Overall, he was a great teammate and I look forward to working with him again in the future." - Tyler Komoroske

### Playing a Part

- I helped Travis teach kids how to code at DSST
- Attended 2 DSA classes taught by Horace
- Part of the newly formed Settlers of Catan Club

### Notes

## A: End-of-Module Assessment

A Turing student is able to demonstrate proficiency at programming in accordance
with the module's content and expectations.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

A Turing student works to maximize their skill growth and demonstrates
that skill across a variety of work.

## C: Group Work & Projects

A Turing student contributes significantly to group projects, helps the team
develop their technical skills, and delivers a high-quality product.

## D: Community Participation

A Turing student builds up the community around them by participating and
supporting other students, the larger Turing family, and persons outside our
walls who want to develop their own skills.

## E: Peer & Instructor Feedback

A Turing student accelerates the growth of those around
them by delivering specific, kind, and actionable feedback. They accelerate their
own growth by taking in and acting on the feedback of their peers and instructors.

### Result: ***
