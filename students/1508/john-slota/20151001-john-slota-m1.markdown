### Work  

#### (Enigma)

during World War 2. My partner was Marlo Major

Let them have the four on overall. Only issue was not following the runner specifications. Code could have been cleaned up. Could have done some refactoring, but fairly well split apart in general.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I like to motivate people and give them positive feedback, I made sure to let Marlo my partner know that
he did a great job on our project. I also let my other partner know, Edgar, that he did some great work
when we finished pieces of our project together.

### Being a Community Member

John was easily one of the best people I’ve ever worked with. Early on, he let me know that he wouldn’t be here for the weekend and so we worked feverishly to finish the assignment long before the weekend. His forward thinking and responsible nature made him an absolute pleasure to work with. I would build almost any project with him again in a heartbeat. I’m excited to do so!

I enjoyed working with John, he is an ambitious and and energetic partner. Although we fell behind in the first weak, Johns
initiative helped us get on track to make a huge comeback when it seemed we would have nothing done.  -Edgar

### Playing a Part

I helped organize a crypto currency club that I'd like to continue as I go through Turing, we had several
Wednesday night meetings and even took a field trip to the Denver Bitcoin Center.
