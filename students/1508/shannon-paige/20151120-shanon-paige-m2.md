From Slota: "It’s unbelievable how awesome Shannon is, the sun is setting on my life now that I will no longer be working with her. In my mind she was the leader of the team, making sure we defined the responsibilities early and more importantly follow through  with them. I don’t know if I’ll ever have the chance to work with such a strong, super cool programmer again but I hope to do so someday, a guy can dream. Thank you Shannon, you rewl!"

From Edgar: "Shannon you are most definitely the key member of our group. Your knowledge and skills were instrumental in helping us complete the project. It was a pleasure working with you and I learned a lot just watching you solve problems. Thanks for all you do."

From Jhun: "Shannon is a wealth of knowledge. It seems like she has a correct answer for everything it’s crazy! Her knowledge or ruby and programming is something I am aspiring to. Her ability to lead a group is amazing and she led us to the end of our project. She’s generous with her time as well. She’s often multiple times to pair with me. The feed back she gave me at then end of our project was the catalyst that pushed me to putting in my rails reps. I look forward to working with her in the future."

## Community

### Giving Feedback
For Amber: "Amber was an amazing teammate on Little Shop. Her energy is infectious and only matched by her drive and talent. Her leadership and determination was responsible for us getting off to a great start and giving us time to implement not 2, but 4 extensions. Her front end development skills blossomed on this project and it was a joy to come in every morning and see what new featured she had implemented. I would love love love to work with Amber on any future projects. In fact I wish I could work with her on all future projects."

For Slota: "There is no way to describe what it’s like to be on a team project with Slota. His enthusiasm and friendliness keep energy up and stress low. His jokes keep you laughing. His willingness to tackle busywork (like cleaning up hound requests) is beyond helpful. And his ideas and insight are beyond valuable. We truly had a Little Shop power team and Slota was a big part of the reason for that. Thank you!!"

For Aaron: "I had never partnered with Aaron before our Rails mini-project and I’m really mad about it, because he was so awesome to work with. He was a great pairing partner and brought so much good energy and good ideas to the table. When I started to go down rabbit holes, he always brought me back. His understanding of Rails was so impressive it encouraged me to study harder to catch up to him. I would definitely work with Aaron again on any project."

For Edgar: "Edgar was a great partner during Traffic Spy. He kept me laughing  the whole time, which made me look forward to all of our pairing sessions. I think we made a great team and I would be happy to work with him again."

For Jhun: "Jhun had such a positive energy during our Traffic Spy project, he was instrumental in keeping our team spirits up, even when we got stressed. I loved his enthusiasm and curiosity. His communication skills are through the roof, and he shows a unique ability of knowing what his weak spots are and going after them. Thanks for you!!"

### Being a Community Member

#### Playing a Part

I started this module by decorating the girls bathroom with 80s posters.
Later in the module I formed the Social Committee with Sam Brock, so we could put together Halloween activities for the school. We also roped in Sekhar and I helped him brainstorm ideas for Field Day.
I also set up the guest speaker on November 13 - Kagan Sound and his wooden puzzle boxes.
