# Edgar Duran - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My main goal for the module was to build a solid foundation in Ruby so that I
may continue to build on top of it in future modules. I wanted to immerse myself
in Ruby as much as possible. I also wish to continue building relationships in this
awesome place where, incredibly, I've really liked everyone.

### End of Module Assessment

For my end of Module assessment I tested with Josh and received the Scrabble Playey class
as my challenge.

Feedback:

* Ruby Syntax:
Mostly kept up to date with the state of the tests
Got a little stuck with moving variable setting to initialize
The adding `@total` within `play` was good

* Ruby Style:
Nice correcting the indentation as you see it

* Blocks and Enumerables:
N/A

* Testing:
Nice descriptions of the behaviour of the Player class
Good test implementation

* Workflow:
Nice use of tools, eg command+d
Jumping between windows

* Collaboration:
Don't require my approval

Scores:

* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3.5
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 4
* Workflow: 4
* Collaboration: 3

### Attendance

I have been in attendance a Turing consistently, with the single exception of
leaving after lunch on one occasion due to illness.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

From Aaron:
Edgar has helped me talk through many hurdles in the first module. He has a great ability to explain concepts in a way that myself and many other students understand. Over this time, he has also become a great friend and ally. I hope to pair together on future projects.

From John:
Edgar was a blast to work with on probably the toughest project that I had at Turing, he
came up with several solutions to confusing and difficult pieces of our code. He is a team
player and level headed which was greatly appreciated as our project was overwhelmingly difficult.

From Matt:
“Edgar brought a lot of energy to our Enigma project. While sometimes he got ahead of himself (like most of us), he’s always excited to share his ideas and open to hearing someone else’s. He was also very willing to work with me regarding our schedule, which is super helpful when you’re trying to still have something of a life outside of school."

### Playing a Part

I tried to be active and participate in the Turing community during this module. I attended the field day, though I had a lot of work pending, because I think it's important to be involved in the community where you spend so much time. I also volunteered to help coordinate the welcome night for the new 1510 cohort as well as regularly trying to be present and lend a hand at Turing whenever possible. I enjoy taking pride in my work area and try to always clean up and keep things around Turing organized whenever possible.
