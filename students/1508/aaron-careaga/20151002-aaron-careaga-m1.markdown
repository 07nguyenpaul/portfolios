# Aaron Careaga - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

I am at Turing to challenge myself, learn a new skillset and way of thought, and combine my interests in technology, finance, and behavioral sciences. The past few weeks have been some of the hardest yet most rewarding I've experienced. Moving from Washington prior to starting the program, and spending 10 to 12 hours a day, almost every day of the module, has taught be a lot about myself, communication and software development.

### End of Module Assessment

I successfully completed the end of module assessment with Josh Cheek on 9/28. My task (Challenge 2: reading game data) was to implement the WordFinder class for the Scrabble game. I built two methods that allowed the user to iterate through a dictionary and returned words that could be built from supplied characters.

**Feedback:**

Josh thought my Ruby syntax and style were in good form, and my code displayed no issues. I rattled 15ish enumerables off the top of my head and eventually found the right enumerable to implement. While testing, I described the method, such that it proves to you that you understand what you're going to go do. I exhibited good tabbing between panes. It took me some time to wrap my head around wording on the spec but we eventually got on the same page.

**Scores:**
* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3


### Attendance

I attended all days and classes on-time, arriving each day about 45 minutes before warmup to review material and prepare.

### Work

I completed the following individual projects during the first module:

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

I recreated the Mastermind game using Ruby and played from the command line. Projected evaluated by Andrew Carmer.

**Notes:**
Noted areas to refactor into contained methods. Conveyed the Ruby syntax and naming was on track.

**Scores:**
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 2
* REPL Interface and Game Functionality: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

I built a Markdown to HTML parser that took in an input text wrote an output file. Projected evaluated by Tess Griffin.

**Notes:**
Tess thought my TDD and Ruby style were strong. Need to fix formatting converter, realign logic that was broken during refactoring.

**Scores:**
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test Driven Development: 4
* Functionality: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Jungle Beat

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/jungle-beat)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

I implemented a link list in Ruby that read an input text file, played the beats, and allowed list manipulation from the command line. Projected evaluated by Mike Dao.

**Notes:**
* 38 tests, all passing
* Some opportunities for refactoring
* some methods could use helper methods that were already built
* testing could use some better specificity
* testing needs to check that methods not only do what they have to do
but also that they dont mess anything up
* Playing functionality needs to be split out
* FileIO needs to be split out
* Great use of the splat
* Many opportunities to refactor and to split off code into individual
methods

**Scores:**
* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3

## Team

### Projects

Below is a list of team projects I participated in during the first module.

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Penney Garrett and myself built an enigma program that encrypted, decrypted, and cracked text. Our project was evaluated by Andrew Carmer.

**Notes:**
* Tests could be more robust. Example - used a lot of refute or assert instead of assert_equal when appropriate. This was due to some random nature of some of the elements. Could have focused on some more edge cases and different scenarios.
* Variable and method naming was strong.
* Cracked encrypted text with great speed.

**Scores:**
* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

**Feedback:**

Aaron was a great partner for Enigma. He is excellent at breaking apart and tackling complicated problems. When the going gets tough he stays calm and just approaches the issue from a different angle. And on a personal note, I'm still struggling a lot with feeling capable enough, and Aaron stayed patient and encouraging the entire process. I really learned a lot from him and feel I've definitely made a friend and ally.  

#### HeadCount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/acareaga/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Matt Rooney and myself built a data analysis suite to help policymakers and the public better understand education statistics in Colorado. Our project was evaluated by _______.

**Notes:**

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I provided critical feedback to partners in both group projects, Penney Garrett and Matt Rooney. I also gave feedback to Elliot Winkler, a mentor in the Lovelace Posse that I met with regularly on Thursday's during the first module.

I wrote feedback for Emily Dowdle and Edgar Duran for their portfolios.

### Being a Community Member

* Emily Dowdle: "Pair programming with Aaron lacked many of the roadblocks I’ve experienced with other pairs. We decided to take five minutes to individually experiment with ideas in IRB and then came together to recursively create a custom method equal to .flatten. Aaron’s positive attitude made him a joy to work with and his logical insights filled the gaps in my own thinking, allowing us to efficiently develop a solution."

### Playing a Part

* I regularly mountain bike with fellow students and instructors, riding at least one day every week of the module.
* I helped David Daniel, a recent Turing graduate, move residences on Saturday, August 29.
* On Monday September 7, I posted a personal blog called Skiers Who Code. Topics covered included my experience at Turing and learning Ruby relative to those I've shared in the mountains.
* On field day, I drove a group of  students and their bikes to the Lulzbot Factory and Devils Backbone open space.
* On Tuesday September 22, I wrote a personal blog on motivation and overcoming challenges. The post discussed my experience handling stress and expectations during the first module, and techniques I've helpful to enter a flow state.
