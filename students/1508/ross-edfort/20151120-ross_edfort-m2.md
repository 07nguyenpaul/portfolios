## Individual

### Your Mission

For module 2, I set out to gain as much knowledge about using the rails framework
as possible, while still maintaining a solid understanding of ruby and remaining
active in the community. I intended to maintain best ruby practices by working through the
enumerable exercises and to maintain active in the community by attending extra-curricular activities
and meetups.

Description: For this project I worked with Cole Hall and Sekhar Paladugu. We built a simple application that simulated
a web traffic tracker. We used Ruby, Sinatra, HTML & CSS. We could simulate a client signing up with our app,
and simulate payloads of data for their site through cURL requests. We parsed and displayed the data accoring
to the project specifications.

Evaluator: Andrew

Comments: Some views are instantiating new objects within them. Need to pull out logic down the stack. Only on one page - so score is still 3 but should be aware it's not good practice. Scores for views and business logic are threes, but were close to twos because of the business logic in views.


Functional Expectations: 3
        TestDriven Development: 3
        Encapsulation / Components: 3
        Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
        Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
        View Layer: 3


"Ross pushed hard on this project and set high standards, helping us finish a completed traffic spy with solid scores. I learned a lot from how he approaches problems and his knowledge helped me learn new concepts like MVC better. Thanks!"
