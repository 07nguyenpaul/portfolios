# Ross Edfort - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### My Mission

For module 2, I set out to gain as much knowledge about using the rails framework
as possible, while still maintaining a solid understanding of ruby and remaining
active in the community. I intended to maintain best ruby practices by working through the
enumerable exercises and to maintain active in the community by attending extra-curricular activities
and meetups.

### Projects

Below are the three team projects I completed this module

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rossedfort/src_traffic_spy)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

Description:For this project I worked with Cole Hall and Sekhar Paladugu. We built a simple application that simulated
a web traffic tracker. We used Ruby, Sinatra, HTML & CSS. We could simulate a client signing up with our app,
and simulate payloads of data for their site through cURL requests. We parsed and displayed the data accoring
to the project specifications.

Evaluator: Andrew

Comments: Some views are instantiating new objects within them. Need to pull out logic down the stack. Only on one page - so score is still 3 but should be aware it's not good practice. Scores for views and business logic are threes, but were close to twos because of the business logic in views.

Scores:
* Functional Expectations: 3
* TestDriven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3
* View Layer: 3

Feedback to me: "Ross pushed hard on this project and set high standards, helping us finish a completed traffic spy with solid scores. I learned a lot from how he approaches problems and his knowledge helped me learn new concepts like MVC better. Thanks!"

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rossedfort/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)
* [Heroku URL](http://lit-lake-7364.herokuapp.com/)

Description: For this un-evaluated mini-project, my pair Emily Dowdle and I completed
a basic rails crud app for storing ideas. Users were able to create and account with our app
and keep track of their ideas and the categories to which they belonged. We implemented
2 extensions by using RSpec for our testing suite, and OAuth for our authorization process.

#### Little Shop of Orders

### Playing a Part

This module I gave back to the Turing community in a few ways. I created a Slack channel open to anyone who enjoys Frisbee Golf.
Since creating the channel, many people have joined and we've had several outings. I believe this is improving the community
by allowing students an outlet to relax and get in some light exercise. I also created an informal Hardware group with Regis which
will meet every Sunday at 2:00pm.
