## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt like I needed to build a string foundation here
at Turing. I wanted to become a part of the community quickly, so for the first
few weeks, I pushed myself to eat lunch with different people every day. I was
active in posse during warmups, and collaborated with almost all of my cohort-mates
throughout the module.

I also put a strong emphasis on learning the basics of Ruby quickly. I thumbed
through the Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby book, and kept the ruby-docs
webpage pinned in my browser. I found myself always asking questions to myself that could
be answered by these resources.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rossedfort/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/sorting-suite/blob/master/Readme.md)

In this project, I implemented 3 different sorting algorithms. They include a
Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and a Merge Sort. I was evaluated by Mike

* Notes: Good testing, some long methods.
* Scores:
  * Functional Expectations: 3
  * Testing: 3
  * Ruby Style: 3
  * Organization: 3

#### Recursive Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rossedfort/linked_list)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/linked_lists.markdown)

In this project I implemented a linked list with recursion. It was
evaluated by Sean with the following results:

* Functional Expectations: 1
  * multiple expectations weren't implemented properly

* Test-Driven Development: 2
  * App was tested, but many assertions were wrong or insufficient, for example,
  the `count` function emptied the list.

* Encapsulation: 1
  * Almost no re-use of code, ultimately caused many bugs

* Ruby & Style: 2
  * Indentation was inconsistent, methods were too long as a result of lack of encapsulation

* Looping or Recursion: 3
  * Showed understanding of a while loop, but not to the point I'd call it excellent

* Personal Notes
  * tests should try to break your code
  * use style guide and adhere to style conventions

#### Binary Search Tree

In this project I am creating a binary search tree [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree), and giving it the functionality to insert and delete nodes, find nodes based on content, find the depth of a particular node, find the minimum and maximum nodes, and sort the contents of the nodes into an array.

As a bonus, I am giving it the functionality to find the maximum height of the tree, and return the number of leaves in the tree.

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rossedfort/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

* Notes: No tests setup, Ruby is well written, Avoid using instance methods when possible.
  More micromachines and small methods

* Scores:
  * Overall: 3
  * Fundamental Ruby: 3
  * TDD: 1
  * Components: 2
