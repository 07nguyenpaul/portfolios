## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I set out to become not only a developer in terms of my technical skill, but
in my ability to communicate intelligently about writing code. I set a goal to start the
job hunt early, and ideally accept a position before graduation. I wanted to accomplish this by
attending more meetups, and networking extensively.

### Work

My only individual project this module was RealTime.

#### RealTime

Realtime involved building an application using JavaScript and Socket.io to allow the server and connected
clients to get a real-time representation of data. In my case, I chose to building a polling application
where the results of the poll were updated as the votes came in.

This module, we worked on two pair projects. They were GameTime and the Scale-up.

#### GameTime

For this project, Robbie and I paired to build a replica of Flappy Bird for the browser. We used images drawn on the canvas, keyboard
input, and our own collision detection to accomplish this.

### Playing a Part

This module I was assigned to a new posse as the posse anchor. I took this on knowing full well it would mean doing some extra work trying to
lead the posse in our morning sessions. That being said, everyone in the posse came together really well, and we were able to get the challenges done.

I also led a student led session during week one. I attended several of the Turing community night events to support the instructors who were
facilitating them.

As part of the ScaleUp project, we were required to write a blog post. Here is mine

We were also encouraged to either write or contribute to a Node Library. Here are my contributions
