### Your Mission

For my first module here at Turing, I set out to get a good grasp on ruby fundamentals.
I feel I made good use of the pre-work and after my evaluation on the Mastermind project,
I was moved from Foxtrot to Echo. In echo, I was more challenged and I believe it was
beneficial to my success during module 1. Beyond learning the basics to writing ruby,
I also feel like I have grown as an individual. Specifically, I think I have greatly improved
my ability with working with others in a collaborative process.

### Attendance

During this module I have had perfect attendance and have never been tardy.  

### Work

For my individual projects during this module, I am most satisfied with my Night Writer and my Mastermind. I thoroughly enjoyed both these projects and feel like i excelled. For Mastermind I completed some of the extensions and also felt my algorithm was well executed. I feel similar for Night Writer, but I think I did really well with TDD on this project.

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

For this project we translated a string into simulated braille. I am most proud of this project, because I feel i did an excellent job using TDD.

Evaluated by Josh Cheek

*"Good job keeping the algorithm and the context decoupled (command line reading / writing files, printing summaries, etc)"*

* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components 4

#### Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbielane/binary_search_tree)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

In this project i created a binary search tree, a fundamental data structure, which stores sorted data for faster lookup. This project helped me solidify my knowledge of recursion.

(feedback to me)
Feedback:
*â€œRobbie was a great partner to work with. He laid out a foundation that was clear and concise with our headcount project. He was very easy to work and pair with and had great insight about all aspects of the project. He has a great work ethic and is always willing to put in the time it takes to get things."*

*"Robbie is amazing to work with. His understanding of Ruby is completely intimidating and inspiring. My only compliant would be that he needs to slow down and wait for the rest of us to catch up!*
