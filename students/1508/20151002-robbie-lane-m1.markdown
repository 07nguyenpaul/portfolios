### Your Mission

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
For my first module here at Turing, I set out to get a good grasp on ruby fundamentals.
I feel I made good use of the pre-work and after my evaluation on the Mastermind project,
I was moved from Foxtrot to Echo. In echo, I was more challenged and I believe it was
beneficial to my success during module 1. Beyond learning the basics to writing ruby,
I also feel like I have grown as an individual. Specifically, I think I have greatly improved
my ability with working with others in a collaborative process.
