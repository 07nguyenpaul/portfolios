## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt weak on ruby. I had self taught myself the basic
syntax but felt very weak on enumerables, working with hashes, and manipulating
arrays. I had never even made a class or a method before. I feel as if I have
learned more than I could even imagine learning so far. I am really pleased
with my progress so far. Ruby is now more of a playground than a minefield.

Initially I also struggled with understanding the concept behind TDD
but now I am driving my code with tests and refactoring methods as I go.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time. I came in an hour early
most of the time to get ready for the day.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Chisel

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/selfup/chisel)

This project was a markdown to HTML converter. I was evaluated by Jeff with
the following results:

"Like that it works!"

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/selfup/linked_list)

In this project I implemented a linked list using both recursion and iteration.
It was evaluated by Mike with the following results:

"Tail method had an iterative and recursive version.
Good that the count method is SRP."

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping / Recursion: 3.5

## Team

#### Enigma

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/selfup/enigma)

In this project we created an encryption/decryption/cracking machine.
It was evaluated by Josh Cheek with the following results:

"Use the interface before it exists, so that you can discover what it should be.
This will lead to elegance."

* Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3-
* Breaking Logic into Components: 2

#### Sales Engine

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine.markdown)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/selfup/sales_engine)

### Feedback to Me

I was told that I need to slow down and communicate more. Ever since said
feedback I have now discovered that writing test first enables me to slow down
and more appropriately describe what I am doing.

### Playing a Part

* On Monday, July 27th, I had my blog post ("The Difference is Huge") included
in that week's Posse Post as well as being featured on the Turing Blog.
* On Friday, July 3rd, I helped cater Andrew's City of Cuernavaca Park picnic.
