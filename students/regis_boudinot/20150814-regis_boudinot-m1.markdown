### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt weak on ruby. I had self taught myself the basic
syntax but felt very weak on enumerables, working with hashes, and manipulating
arrays. I had never even made a class or a method before. I feel as if I have
learned more than I could even imagine learning so far. I am really pleased
with my progress so far. Ruby is now more of a playground than a minefield.

be careful not to use local variable names that match a method
Good that the count method is SRP
