# Jeff Ruane - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Coming into Module 4, I'm super excited to be learning JavaScript, as well as web scalability. I'm also super excited and nervous about looking for jobs, and to be finishing up soon. It's a strange feeling, but I think one important thing to focus on this module is ignoring that feeling, and just focusing on learning as much as I can while I'm here. I also want to focus on trying to maybe put myself out there a little bit more for the lower modules. I'm always happy to help, but I don't think any of them know that.

### Work

My overall point total for the module, without taking the final, was 966/1104 for a percentage of 87.5.

#### Idea Box 2.0

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbrr/ideabox-2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)
* [Heroku Deployment](https://jbrr-ideabox2.herokuapp.com)

In this project, I made IdeaBox again using jQuery, AJAX, and a Rail API. I was evaluated by Lovisa and received a total score of 148/150. This project was definitely stressful, it felt like being thrown into the deep end of the pool, similar to module 1. In the end, I walked away with a much better understanding of AJAX and jQuery, and was starting to feel more comfortable with JavaScript in general, although I think that Game Time really started to solidify some concepts (and syntax) for me.

#### ThoughtBox
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbrr/thought-box)
* [Original Assignment](https://gist.github.com/stevekinney/82831c5b25029415ce8b)

In this project, I had 7 hours to make (most of) a CRUD app in Rails with a JavaScript front end. I was evaluated by Meeka and received a total score of 95/100. This project was a great refresher for working with Rails, and the time pressure on it made it really interesting.

#### Real Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbrr/crowdsource)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)
* [Heroku Deployment](http://jbrr-crowdsource.herokuapp.com)

In this project, I worked with Node, Express, and Socket.io to create a real time voting app. I was evaluated by Meeka and received a total score of 154/200. I was not concerned with styling for this project, so the page itself is pretty bare, but I knew my point total coming into it and I knew I was in a good position, so I decided to devote more of my time to trying to help classmates rather than expanding my own project.

### Projects

#### SkiFree (Game Time)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbrr/ski-free)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)
* [GitHub Pages Deployment](https://jbrr.github.io/ski-free)

In this project, I worked with Rose Kohn to make a JavaScript implementation of the classic Microsoft game SkiFree. We were evaluated by Meeka and received a total score of 340/300. This project was a blast, Rose and I work well together so we had a good time with it. It was an interesting dynamic, because I just had to try to keep up with trying to test and refactor all the awesome features she was adding.

## Community

### Playing a Part

* I was voted to Student Advisory Board by my peers this module.
* I volunteered to be a part of the "buddy" system with a module 1 student, Adam Hundley, this module. I checked in with him at least weekly, tried to help him with handling the stress of Turing(although he had a pretty good handle on that from the beginning), and helped him with some code when I could.
* I haven't gotten specific feedback from people, but Meeka sent me a message on January 15, 2016: "I’ve heard from more than one of your fellow classmates that you’ve been a great help to them in this module and that you’re very well respected."
