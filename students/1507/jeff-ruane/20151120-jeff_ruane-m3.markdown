### Your Mission

Coming into Module 3, I think my biggest concern is simply keeping up with the workload. I know this module is difficult, and I really don't want to fall behind at any point. Last module, I don't think I put as much effort into a lot of the individual, ungraded assignments as I should have, and I don't want to make that mistake again. Over the break, I think I've gotten some much needed perspective, and realized that this whole program is only 7 months, and I'm already halfway through it, and there's really no excuse to not put in as much effort as possible while I'm here. So, my goal for this module is to work as hard as possible, and not be as easily distracted by friends who want to go have fun. The effort that I put in now will directly effect where I am in a couple months when I'm searching for a job.

I think I did a much better job as far as contributing to the community last module, and I'd like to keep that up. In general, I just want to make myself available to module 1 and 2 students, while still not being pushy. I don't like the idea of offering help if I haven't been asked, because the struggle of trying to figure out a problem is so valuable, but I'd like for other students to know that I'm always willing to help if I can. I also want to keep going strong with Kids Who Code. It has been a really valuable experience so far, both for me and for the kids (from what their parents have been telling me), so I'd like to keep helping with that as much as possible. Also, I've noticed that the people volunteering to help are all module 3 and 4 students, so I'd really like to encourage some module 1 and 2 students to help out so that hopefully Kids Who Code can be sustained after we leave Turing.

Aside from that, I still have a lot of the same goals as last module. I want to keep learning other skills when I have time, and I still think that shell scripting is a good place to put that effort into. I also want to keep pursuing other passions, specifically photography.
