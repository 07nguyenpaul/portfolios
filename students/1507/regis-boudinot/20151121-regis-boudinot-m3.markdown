# Regis Boudinot - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

This module I want to increase my understanding of Rails, and increase my understanding of DevOps. I have so far given back to the community as much I can with DevOps and I hope to be able to continually do so. This is such an important skill that we should all know, and I am glad to teach those willing to learn. I also want to get people more into hardware. I never really knew how to program before I came to Turing, and I want to be able to do cool stuff with hardware. My Personal Project will be hardware based if it gets approved and I am excited to learn what is not taught!

### Feedback to Me

I was told:

"Best group ever! I think we all worked together super well, never got too stressed, and got to do lots of cool shit. I especially appreciated your enthusiasm and excitement throughout the project, I think it added a lot to the group dynamic. You’re also constantly curious, and always wanting to try new stuff, and I appreciate that too. I’m not sure if I really have a poopsicle for you, that project was an absolute blast the whole way through."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave feedback to a number of my classmates and they were happy that my
feedback was actionable and supportive.

Here are some examples:

"Jeff: Was the best team lead I have had yet. He was not aggressive, and was not too laid back. He let the team work on their ideas and gave mini deadlines to be sure we weren’t getting lost. He really helped improve my experience at Turing. I never felt pushed, and he was also reassuring. The only poopsicle I can think of for Jeff is that he might be too laid back but other than that he has a really good head on his shoulders."

### Playing a Part

* During the leading intermission week I helped setup computers for 1510. I also gave a talk with 1508 about what to expect.
* The first week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a rails environment in a Vagrant Box. (12 students)
* The second week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a rails environment on Digital Ocean. (12 students)
* The third week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a production environment on Digital Ocean. (10 students)
* The fifth week of the module I held a student led session on programming Arduinos with Ruby and C.
