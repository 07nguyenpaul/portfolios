# Regis Boudinot - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

This module I want to increase my understanding of Rails, and increase my understanding of DevOps. I have so far given back to the community as much I can with DevOps and I hope to be able to continually do so. This is such an important skill that we should all know, and I am glad to teach those willing to learn. I also want to get people more into hardware. I never really knew how to program before I came to Turing, and I want to be able to do cool stuff with hardware. My Personal Project will be hardware based if it gets approved and I am excited to learn what is not taught!

### Feedback to Me

I was told:

"I think you could benefit from planning code out before implementing it.
When pairing, it can be confusing to follow your train of thought before you
have planned it out"

"But overall, I think you are a great person to have in the community.
You’re outgoing, easy to approach, etc."

"Regis has been a great addition to Turing.  He has always been willing and able
to help me with most things. If I had any negative feedback for him it’s that he
needs to be more confident in himself. He got stressed out in the beginning but
mostly because he didn’t think he was capable enough which he is. Remember that
emotions can be contagious."

I need to slow down and communicate more. Ever since said
feedback I have now discovered that writing test first enables me to slow down
and more appropriately describe what I am doing. Testing also helps me build
confidence.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave feedback to a number of my classmates and they were happy that my
feedback was actionable and supportive.

Here are some examples:

### Playing a Part

* On Monday, July 27th, I had my blog post ("The Difference is Huge") included
in that week's Posse Post as well as being featured on the Turing Blog.
* On Friday, July 3rd, I helped cater Andrew's City of Cuernavaca Park picnic.
