## Individual

### Mission Statement

This module I want to teach more people about DevOps and enable them to be able to teach DevOps once I am done. I also want to learn Python while learning ES6. I also want to focus on the job search. So some projects might take a hit from doing so, but the point system was built with this in mind! I am also excited to learn more about Node and Express!

### End of Module Assessment

N/A

* Total Points: 923

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes.

### Work

#### IdeaBox

* Points: 159/150

Notes: Refactor Ajax calls and replace instead of remove/append. Good use of ES6.

#### ThoughtBox

* Points: 40/100

Notes (My Own): Was deep in the job search and had 2 phone interviews that day. Really enjoyed the challenge but my plate was full!

#### Real Time

Title: Crowdsource

* [GitHub Url](https://github.com/selfup/crowdsource)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

* Points: 153/200

Notes (My Own): Learned a lot! Was busy helping people with their own projects and putting out Digital Ocean dumpster fires.

Notes (Horace):

* functionality is solid - works well with no hiccups; effectively satisfies expected use cases
* UI is nothing fancy but is clean and easy to follow. Adds enough color and a standard design
palette to make things feel unified.
* Workflow is solid - lots of branches and commits; seems to have an effective process around tracking
progress
* Server side code is overall pretty easy to follow; major weakness is the size of the main namespace --
next steps might be to look at pulling this apart
* Separating the app logic more explicitly would help make the connections between the pieces more
obvious
* Additionally would probably make testing easier since we would have more explicit insight into
the connections between pieces of our system

### Personal Project (Non Curriculum Based)

* [GitHub Url](https://github.com/selfup/DevOpsOne)

#### DevOpsOne

Notes: Did this during the 2 weeks break. Learned more about Linux than I could have imagined.

Purpose: To dive deeper into DevOps and learn how to script in Python as well as Ruby. This repo can setup up fresh Debian based VM's/VPS's/Desktops in around 6 minutes with Ruby/Rails/Node/Postgres and more.

Eventually I branched off and learned Docker. I can build an initial Docker container by cloning this repo and running my scripts in the Dockerfile in around the same amount of time. Then once the provision has been cached, spinning up new containers takes about 1 to 2 seconds.

#### Game Time

* Points 345/300

Notes (My Own): Really really enjoyed this project. Opened my eyes on how complex static apps can be. This is where I dove deep into

Two blog posts were written by Zach and myself.

### Feedback to Me

I was told:

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave feedback to a number of my classmates and they were happy that my
feedback was actionable and supportive.

Here are some examples:

### Playing a Part

* I helped set up 4 students on Digital Ocean running production environments. One of them is in Module 2!
* Wrote 4 Blog Posts during Mod 4. Here is a link to my [Blog](https://medium.com/@rboudinot)
* Every Sunday at 2 or 3 pm I taught a mix of Javascript/Arduinos/Raspberry Pi/Ruby for an hour or two
* The first week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a rails environment in a Vagrant Box (again). (10 students)
* The second week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a rails environment on Digital Ocean (again). (7 students)
* The third week of the module I held a student led session on setting up a production environment on Digital Ocean (again). (5 students)
* During the 2 week intermission break I learned how to use Docker and made my own automation scripts for setting up fresh Debian based VPS's/Desktops/VM's. The script repo also includes scripts to setup a production environment for rails apps on both OSX and Debian based machines. I use my automation scripts in my Dockerfile to set up containers from scratch.
* During Field Day I held a 3 hour session on learning Python as well as OOP in Python. (10 students)

* As of Wednesday of this week these are my GitHub Stats:
