# Regis Boudinot - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Satement

My Mission this module is to help the incoming cohort as best I can while
managing my heavy workload. I also want to teach people more about GNU/Linux
and DevOps because I find those areas of technology to be fascinating.
My passion for learning about new technologies is ever growing and I hope to
be able to give back my knowledge as well as give back to the community
new and interesting ideas.

## Notes -

"Nervous but came through and performed well. Threw some unused things at him
and he was comfortable with implementing them with some collaboration. We ran
into a road block while passing through params that I couldn't figure out right
away either, but we collaborated and came to find the issue. Was well aware of
tools to use for troubleshooting and was aware of good testing practices. Was a
little shaky with minitest but could articulate what he would have done
with RSpec and we moved on from there."

"Overall a solid performance. Syntax and styling was good."

### Feedback to Me

### Giving Feedback

### Playing a Part

* I actively went out of my way to help Module 1 students to not only give
back my knowledge but to also keep up to date on my Ruby.
* On Monday, July 27th, I held a student led session on GNU/Linux and how to
mimic a DevOps environment. I also demonstrated how to customize a basic Linux
distro and how to get Ruby, Node, and Rails.
* On Friday, July 3rd, I performed well on giving my lightning talk about
Nuclear Fusion.
