# Regis Boudinot - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Satement

My Mission this module is to help the incoming cohort as best I can while
managing my heavy workload and teaching others about new topics.
I want to teach people more about GNU/Linux and DevOps because I find
those areas of technology to be fascinating. My passion for learning about new
technologies is ever growing and I hope to be able to give back my knowledge as
well as give back to the community new and interesting ideas.

### End of Module Assessment

#### Instructor - Andrew

#### Challenge - Highest Scoring Word

#### Notes -

"Nervous but came through and performed well. Threw some unused things at him
and he was comfortable with implementing them with some collaboration. We ran
into a road block while passing through params that I couldn't figure out right
away either, but we collaborated and came to find the issue. Was well aware of
tools to use for troubleshooting and was aware of good testing practices. Was a
little shaky with minitest but could articulate what he would have done
with RSpec and we moved on from there."

"Overall a solid performance. Syntax and styling was good."

### Feedback to Me

"Intensely patient, Regis is one of the people around Turing you know that you
can always go to for quality and attentive help on any issue. A real credit to
the Turing community. Immensley curious and a fantastic teacher, his
excitement is contagious."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

"Provides great valuable feedback. Speaks his mind and gives you accurate and
actionable feedback when needing help with refactoring or building base logic.
Strong in ruby and very strong at testing. Chad is a valuable
resource that can be called upon at reasonable times."

### Playing a Part

* I actively went out of my way to help Module 1 students to not only give
back my knowledge but to also keep up to date on my Ruby.
* On Friday, August 24th, I held a student led session on GNU/Linux and how to
mimic a DevOps environment. I gave instructions and how to setup a VM and boot
linux in a Virtual Box Machine. I also demonstrated how to customize a basic
Linux Distro and how to get Ruby, Node, and Rails.
* On Friday, September 25th, I performed well on giving my lightning talk about
Nuclear Fusion. People seemed very interested in hearing more about the topic.
