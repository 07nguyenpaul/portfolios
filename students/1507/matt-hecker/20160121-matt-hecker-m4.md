This module has been alot of off-road learning to me


Alot of figuring out what I would enjoy working on. I had this idea at the start of the session that there was alot of wisdom in the idea of specializing in something ( a combination of stories from passionate programmer, podcast, youtubes. )



## Idea box
I turned this into an exercise in user experience. I wanted it to be as easy and intuitive to use as possible.

"but its just a crud app."

It still ended up being very educational!

a style of building the structure and elements of computer programsâ€”that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow.

I had a whole bunch of moving objects with changing properties that followed specific rules, rather than having the logic dictate those properties and rules to the objects as the game progressed all the objects knew how they were supposed to interact from the outset and to animate the game I simply had to hand those objects to very few generic functions.

## real-time

This was about Node for me. Im really intrigued by Node and its contrasting philosophy to rails (convention and all in one tool vs many small composable tools). I went into this project with a willful ignorance of how any Node frameworks
