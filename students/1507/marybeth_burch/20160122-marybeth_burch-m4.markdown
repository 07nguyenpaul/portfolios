## Individual

### Your Mission

I am entering Module 4 excited to learn Javascript and client-side development. I know it will be a challenge, as it's something very new to me. At this point in my Turing career, I am getting better at learning and dealing with challenges. I want to continue doing my best and working hard, but I also want to be easier on myself and give myself credit for what I already know instead of getting frustrated by all I don't know. I'd like to experiment with different strategies in my code and try new ways of doing things. I want to remain focused on Turing and continue supporting our community, while also starting to look at next steps and be proactive in my job search.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an absence on December 18th when I was sick. I am consistently on time and try to do warm-up even if my posse isn't around.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Ideabox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/ideabox-js)
* [Production URL](https://ajaxinthebox.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

This project is a basic app for recording ideas. I used JavaScript and jQuery to provide a responsive client-side interface. I used AJAX to communicate between client and server. A basic Rails app manages the data.

Scores: 151/150 points
* Data Model: 5/5
* Viewing Ideas: 10/10
* Adding a new idea: 15/15
* Deleting an existing idea: 15/15
* Changing the quality of an idea: 10/15
* Editing an existing idea: 20/20
* Idea Filtering and Searching: 15/15
* Specification Adherence: 10/10
* User Interface: 5/5
* Testing: 8/10
* Ruby and Rails Quality: 10/10

#### Realtime

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/votestance)
* [Production URL](https://votestance.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

Our goal for this project was to build a real time application with WebSockets. I built a Node application using Express and Socket.io. The app allows users to create polls, share polls with voters, and gather votes in real time. The poll administrator can choose whether or not to share results with voters, and can set a time for the poll to automatically close.

Scores: 165/200 points
* Concept & Features: 75/100 (Met expectations as outlined by the user personas, the application is a solid first version. All planned features were delivered.)
* Code Quality: 25/30 (Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.)
* Client-Side Application: 30/30 (Your application has exceptionally well-factored code with little or now duplication and all components separated out into logical components.)
* Test-Driven Development: 25/30 (The code demonstrates high test coverage. It is tests at controller and unit levels. All controller/routes are tested. There are no failing tests.)
* Interface: 5/5 (The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use)
* Workflow: 5/5 (The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.)

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Game Time

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/mbburch/beatbox)
* [Production URL](http://russelleh.github.io/beatbox)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

Our goal for this project was to build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project. We used client-side JavaScript to complete this project. Our game, Beatbox, is a spin-off of Guitar Hero and Tap Tap Revenge. Play our game here: [Beatbox](http://russelleh.github.io/beatbox/)

Scores: 335/300 points

* Second Check In Goals: 50/50
* Third Check In Goals: 50/50
* Functional Expectations: 35/35
* User Interface: 15/15

## Community

### Playing a Part

* I facilitated a student-led session on Sonic Pi.
* Weekly participant in the Joan Clarke Society
* I was a new student buddy and reached out to students in modules one and two.
* I attended improv, and found that most of the activities done were ones that I had facilitated as an instructor. I've been thinking about how I can use my resources like this to help Turing.
* I pick up after others, run the dishwasher, and do some cleanup every day.
* I'm present for warm-up every day and actively contribute. I try warm-up even when I'm the only one from my posse.
* I went to meetups to try and connect with the larger community. I'm trying to help re-organize the Women Who Code Ruby study group.
