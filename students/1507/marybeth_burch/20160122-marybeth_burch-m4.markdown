### Your Mission

I am entering module 4 excited to learn Javascript and client-side development. I know it will be a challenge, as it's something very new to me. At this point in my Turing career, I am getting better at learning and dealing with challenges. I want to continue doing my best and working hard, but I also want to be easier on myself and give myself credit for what I already know instead of getting frustrated by all I don't know. I'd like to experiment with different strategies in my code and try new ways of doing things. I want to remain focused on Turing and continue supporting our community, while also starting to look at next steps and be proactive in my job search.

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
* Facilitated a student-led session on Sonic Pi
* Weekly participant in the Joan Clarke Society
* I was a new student buddy and reached out to students in modules 1 and 2.
* I attended improv, and found that most of the activities done were ones that I had facilitated as an instructor. I've been thinking about how I can use my resources like this to help Turing.
* I pick up after others, run the dishwasher, and do some cleanup every single day.
* I'm present for warm-up every day and actively contribute. I think my posse is awesome. I've started trying to organize a posse gathering outside of school with mentors and have a little interest, but need to follow through.
