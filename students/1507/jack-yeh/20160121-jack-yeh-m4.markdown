### Giving Feedback

George: Jack fit in quickly and easily to our cohort. He was always eager to learn more and was respectful and enthusiastic about soliciting and receiving help. Helped brainstorm and support ideas for Kids Who Code.

Travis: Jack was a great partner. I love how deliberate his thought process is when tackling a problem. Sometimes I felt like I would start to sprint down one path of reasoning that wasnâ€™t necessarily the best method, and in these sorts of situations Jack would typically reign me back in and be a needed dose of skepticism until the idea we were juggling was fully fleshed out. On the same token, I thinks sometimes Jack was a little too reticent to try out potential solutions to a problem, so potentially a little more cowboy coding might serve him well. Also, I LOVE that Jack likes testing. Yay testing.

Matt: Jack Yeh, Was excellent to pair with. When we paired for some reason I was really nervous at the start. His demeanor and conversational style completely diffused that and Before long ideas were flowing freely and we were both having fun with the code.  I appreciate that he let me know when we were not on the same page but also reassuring me that we were on the same page. It boosted the confidence level and just made the whole experience much more interactive
