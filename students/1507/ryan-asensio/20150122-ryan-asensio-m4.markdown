# Ryan Asensnio - Module 4 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, I wanted to take on some real challenges. I did this especially during GameTime, where I completed the project in Clojure. I also consider the job hunt an extra challenge. I did some pretty crafty things to secure interviews.

A downside of this module was being unmotivated to go beyond initial goals. After completing Gametime during the first week, I did very little the second week. After securing a job offer, I completed very few other assignments. I sort of feel bad, but I'm starting work on Feb 1st and think that I will be working A whole bunch. So maybe a break from the stress is a good thing.

### Individual Projects

The individual projects for this module are as follows:

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Production]()
* [Original Assignment]()

I did not find this project particularly challening, but it was still fun to learn how to use AJAX to cut the fat out of an application.

##### Takeaway

  * AJAX is fun.
  * Javascript was easy to pick up.
  * I need to not use Javascript for Gametime, otherwise it might get boring.

#### GameTime

  * [GitHub URL]()
  * [Production]()
  * [Original Assignment]()

I completed this project in Clojure, with some help from Horace. It was extremely stessful for about 4 days, getting the environment set up. After that, it went pretty smootly, and only had trouble with integrating some ReactJS components.

##### Takeaway

  * I CAN DO ANYTHING
  * A job in Clojure would be cool

### Other Stuff

#### Living Clojure

Worked through almost all of this book. Learned a bunch of new things about Clojure (async, threading, transactions, web apps)

#### BigML 

Familiarized myself with my new company's product. 

#### Reagent

Built part of a CRUD app with ClojureScript's library for ReactJS.
