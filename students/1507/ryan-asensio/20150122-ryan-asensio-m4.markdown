# Ryan Asensnio - Module 4 Portfolio

### Areas of Emphasis

This module, I wanted to take on some tough challenges. I did this especially during GameTime, where I completed the project in Clojure. I also consider the job hunt an extra challenge. I did some pretty crafty things to secure interviews.

A downside of this module was being unmotivated to go beyond initial goals. After completing Gametime during the first week, I did very little the second week. After securing a job offer, I completed very few assignments. I sort of feel bad about this, but I'm starting work on Feb 1st and think that I will be working A whole bunch. So maybe a break from the stress is a good thing. I get mixed opinions on this.

### Individual Projects

The individual projects for this module were as follows:

#### Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/idea-box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

I did not find this project particularly challenging, but it was still fun to learn how to use AJAX to cut the fat out of an application.

##### Takeaway

  * AJAX is fun.
  * Javascript was easy to pick up.
  * I need to not use Javascript for Gametime, otherwise it might get boring.

#### GameTime

  * [GitHub URL](https://github.com/rasensio1/gametime)
  * [Production](http://rasensio1.github.io/gametime/)
  * [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

I completed this project in Clojure with some help from Horace. It was extremely stressful for about 4 days, getting the environment set up. Seriously Stressful. After that, it went pretty smoothly. Felt pretty bipolar.

##### Takeaway

  * I CAN DO ANYTHING
  * Help is necessary
  * A job in Clojure would be cool

### Other Stuff

#### Living Clojure

Worked through almost all of this book. Learned a bunch of new things about Clojure, and programming in general (async channels, threading, transactions, web apps).

#### BigML 

Familiarized myself with my new company's product. 

#### Python/Django

Built a CRD app that consumes an api.

#### Reagent

Built a CRD app with ClojureScript's library for ReactJS.
