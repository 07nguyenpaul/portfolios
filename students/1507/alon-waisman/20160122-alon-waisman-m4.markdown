# Alon Waisman - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

ECMAScript... what else can I say?
Well, that and figuring out how to get a job. I'm still really bad at finding a job and convincing someone it's a good idea to hire me - very much a work-in-progress.

## Personal Projects

### Revenge of IdeaBox, aka IdeaBox w/AJAX

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MowAlon/ideabox-ajax)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

#### Description

Spiritual successor to [IdeaBox](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/idea_box.markdown) - an app that stores users' ideas with full CRUD functionality.

"Throughout the project, one of our focuses will be on providing a fluid and responsive client-side interface. To this end, we'll rely on JavaScript and jQuery to implement snappy filtering in the browser, and AJAX to enable inconspicuous communication between client and server."

#### Description

"Build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project. You'll be using client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project."

This project is inspired by [Minicade](http://minica.de/).

* Use client-side to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Use jQuery to traverse and manipulate the DOM
* Use test-driven design to build a client-side applicaiton

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

#### Description

"In this project, we're going to head off the beaten track for a bit and build real time applications with WebSockets. When the server gets new information, it pushes it out to all of the connected clients.
You will choose the approach that you feel works best."

* Build a rich web application that leverages WebSockets to push data to connected clients in real time.
* Leverage simple data structures to manage the state of your application.
* Evaluate the trade-offs involved in different approaches and make informed decisions about your application's design and architecture.

**Meeka** got mad at me for not testing ThoughtBox

**Matt Hecker** "No, dude, I don't want to give you any feedback."
