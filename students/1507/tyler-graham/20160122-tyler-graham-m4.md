  # Tyler Graham - Module 4 Portfolio

#### Mission

Coming into this module I was excited to learn Javascript because I knew I would probably need it at some point during the creation of my company's application. However, what I most needed to learn was how to link Javascript with an existing back-end framework and how to leverage the unique qualities of Javascript to make an app look smooth and performant.

#### Module summary & takeaways

Module 4 delivered on teaching what I was hoping to learn. Although I certainly wouldn't call myself a Javascript master, I know enough now to truly polish the front-end of an application and to add the speed and smoothness expected from good software.

As for the structure of the module itself, I felt that module 4 was probably the most "balanced" in terms of allowing free time to explore self-directed learning or other work. I also felt that the timing of lessons and projects worked very well.

The one area in which I think there could be some improvement was in the pub/sub and redis lessons leading up to real-time. Redis was covered so little that I didn't feel comfortable using it in my project. I also felt there could have been more clarity on how pub/sub, etc. fits into the bigger picture of using express and sockets; we talked about each part individually but it may be helpful to provide a little more clarification on how/why they work together in the bigger picture of a real-time application.

## Major Projects
I completed the following major projects this module:

### IdeaBox
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgraham777/idea_box_2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/idea_box.markdown)

**Score: 152/150**

* Data Model - 5
* Viewing Ideas - 10
* Adding a new idea - 15
* Deleting an existing idea - 15
* Changing the quality of an idea - 15
* Editing an existing idea - 20
* Idea Filtering and Searching - 15
* Specification Adherence - 10
* User Interface - 5
* Testing - 6
* Ruby and Rails Quality - 10
* JavaScript Style - 6
* Workflow - 10
* *Extension: inline editing - 10*

Comments:
* IdeaBox was my first real stab at manipulating the DOM with Javascript and jquery. As such, it was both frightening and incredibly rewarding.
* It wasn't until my final project assessment at the end of the module (see comments on "Real-time" below), but I finally figured out how I could have properly (or at least more properly) structured my jquery functions on IdeaBox to avoid duplication of event listeners, etc.

### Game Time
The glory of [Assessment Time!](https://chriscenatie.github.io/meteor_shower/)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgraham777/meteor_shower)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

**Score: 305/300**

Comments:
* My favorite project at Turing.
* Game Time did for me with Javascript what Sales Engine did with Ruby: it finally helped me understand how to structure functions and objects, separate their resposnbilities, and make them work together. In that respect I would say it was probably the most valuable project of the model for me.

### ThoughtBox (practice final)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgraham777/practice_final)

**Score: 60/100**

Comments:
* A much-needed refresher on building a rails app. Overall I was happy with how much I was able to remember.
* Not having time to make it to the final Javascript iteration hurt me, though I feel that is over-represented in the score. I personally was proud of the final product.

### Real-time
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgraham777/poll_it_together)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/real_time.markdown)

**Score: 164/200**

Comments:
* The rubric was particularly tough on this project, but overall I was happy with the final product.
* There was some significant refactoring that I could have done in the server and in some of my jquery functions that I didn't even know was possible. Going over that with Steve during my eval was extremely beneficial for my understanding of the language and helped me see more of the power of Javascript.

### Extra Credit
* I completed the first three Javascript exercisms after "hello world" (Leap, Hamming, RNA Transcription) and then compared my approach to five others for each exercise.
* Link to the gist [here.](https://gist.github.com/tgraham777/9f284f096ba9da89a159)

## Community

* On Friday, January 15th, I delivered a lightning talk on the "Global Hacking War." I explored the history of cyber-terrorism and cyber-security and discussed some ways to protect code from infiltration by hackers.
* Over the course of the module I paired with several students from modules 1-3 to help them with various issues. I learned that no matter how far I go in life, the ghost of Sales Engine will always be there to haunt me.
* I continue to refer current Turing students and alumni to Qwinix Technologies, a full-stack DevOps firm that is partnered with my company.
* Going forward, there is a good chance I will be responsible for finding some candidates to hire on at my firm to help in the construction of an advanced financial research application. Having seen firsthand the capabilities of Turing graduates, I think one or more current or future alumni could make a great fit.
