### Your Mission

This module was all about JS. Javascript was one of the reason I chose to come to Turing and I wanted to learn from Steve. This was by far my favorite module. Real Time was the first project that I felt like I could play with code and try multiple approaches for each problem. There is still a lot of javascript that I would like to better understand but I feel like what I've learned over the pass few months has helped me tremendously as a developer.


### End of Module Assessment

I didn't have take the final assessment due to points. However, the final honestly seemed pretty easy. Thoughtbox was a lot of fun and I really enjoy working with the javascript side of things and I feel comfortable building an api in ruby.

### Attendance

My attendance was not great this module. It's not an excuse, however my life outside of Turing is a little hectic. I have coded more this module than any other and applied myself as much as I could. I'm proud of the things I was able to complete both in and outside of Turing.

### Work

I loved all the projects in this module.

In this project, we're going to head off the beaten track for a bit and build real time applications with WebSockets. When the server gets new information, it pushes it out to all of the connected clients.

Build a game that is playable in the browser. There is no server-side component for this project. You'll be using client-side JavaScript exclusively to complete this project.
