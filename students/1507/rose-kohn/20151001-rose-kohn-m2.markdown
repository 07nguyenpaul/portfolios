#### Feedback from

Traffic Spy Group: Assertive in group dynamics (communication), cares about not understanding, big picture vision.

“Rose did good!" - Bret Doucette

"Rose is very motivated by completing concrete goals and achieving tangible goals. She also has a very strong knack for leveraging social capital to reach solutions to problems. When she puts her mind to something, she has strong logical reasoning skills that help her find solutions to a problem. Rose is sometimes distracted when trying to focus on a task, and has room for growth in practicing better habits both during classroom instruction and during work time in terms of removing things that distract her." - Travis Haby

#### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Attended Rocky Mountain Ruby Conference.
* Attended Women Who Code Ruby Study Group at Turing.
* Supported Lovisa during her Denver.rb class.
* Interviewed Module 1 students for the Turing Podcast.
* Attended the documentary movie night Lovisa put on and helped get snacks for everyone.
* Attended warmup with my posse every morning.
