# Rose Kohn - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Mission Statement

This module I was worried about being able to keep up and catch up based on
where I thought I was and how much time I had been able to invest in prep for it
to begin, as well as based on the reputation that Module 3 carries.  My goals were
to be able to keep focused, keep up, get stronger at Rails, and be able to do
what's required on my own (for the most part).  I've really enjoyed this module.
The content has been really interesting, the group I had worked exceedingly well
together, and I felt confident about the projects I put out.

### Feedback to Me

I was told:

"I think you could benefit from planning code out before implementing it.
When pairing, it can be confusing to follow your train of thought before you
have planned it out"

"But overall, I think you are a great person to have in the community.
You’re outgoing, easy to approach, etc."

"Regis has been a great addition to Turing.  He has always been willing and able
to help me with most things. If I had any negative feedback for him it’s that he
needs to be more confident in himself. He got stressed out in the beginning but
mostly because he didn’t think he was capable enough which he is. Remember that
emotions can be contagious."

I need to slow down and communicate more. Ever since said
feedback I have now discovered that writing test first enables me to slow down
and more appropriately describe what I am doing. Testing also helps me build
confidence.
