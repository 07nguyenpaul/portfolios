# Travis Haby - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Become a solid JavaScript developer and further cement best practices for code design and workflow in both JavaScript and Ruby. I put a lot of effort into refactoring
code to be more DRY and more readable.

### End of Module Assessment

N/A - Didn't have to take due to sufficient points accumulated during the module.

### Attendance

I attended all days of this module at Turing punctually.

### Work

#### Side Project

I built a [reatively simple data analysis app](http://urban-leaders-dashboard.herokuapp.com) for my girlfriend's work to practice serving 
up an API with Rails and using the lodash library of JavaScript to manipulate data, along with some plug and play bar graphs from
highcharts.com to display an analysis of the applicants filtered by race, gender, and progress through the application process.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

###### Description

This project went pretty well, but was definitely a struggle in terms of trying to use only functional JavaScript to keep track of a bunch
moving parts. As I'm sure it was intended to do it made me REALLY appreciate OO javascript using prototype methods.

##### Notes

**Total:** 176/200 Points

###### Concept and Features

* 85 points - Met expectations as outlined by the user personas, the application is a solid first version. All planned features were delivered.

###### Code Quality (JavaScript and/or Ruby)

* 27 points - Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical components. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

###### Client-Side Application

* 25 points - Your application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs.

###### Test-Driven Development

* 30 points - The code demonstrates high test coverage. It is tested at the feature, controller and unit levels. It tests the WebSocket as well as the controller endpoints.

###### Interface

* 4 points - The application has many strong pages/interactions, but a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

###### Workflow

* 5 points - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## Team

### Projects

#### GameTime

This project was a clone of the 1942 game for the original nintendo. In Turing fashion, we put our instructors' heads on the game and
trolled Horace by having the "airplane" (Jorge's head) fire poop emojis.

### Playing a Part

This module I continued as much as possible to pop in on projects being worked on by students in lower modules. Typically I would help
them pass one small test or think through a solution to the current problem they were grappling with. Yesterday (1/20/16) I paired with
Alex and Matt for a few hours on the end of their Black Thrusday project. We passed one of their last tests from the spec harness and
submitted a PR to fix the wording of the project spec.

I also organized a guest-teaching trip to DSST College View Middle School (where I taught last year) for ~12 students from Turing. We
taught 8th grade students there the basics of HTML. Students there seemed to really enjoy seeing code they wrote immediately resulting
changed to the webpage they were looking at, and the participants from Turing said they had fun and enjoyed the experience. The computer
science teacher that I partnered with on this said that he would definitely be interested in bringing more Turing students/community members
back to represent the face of prgramming in the real world, as well as an example of adults continuing to value and pursue education.
