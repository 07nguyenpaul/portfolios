# Travis Haby - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I tried to focus on workflow, using tools, and of course understanding the beast that is Rails. I feel like I really solidified my practice with git, as well as sped up my workflow by using shortcuts in Atom as well as other tools to take some of the mundane aspects of programming away. I am really excited to feel like I understand Rails pretty well. It's cool to see all kinds of error messages and know exactly what file to look in for the next step given the output of the error. Exciting!

### Feedback to Me

##### Traffic Spy
From Matt:
  I knew that Travis was already a great communicator but throughout project he constantly surprised me with how patient he was. I announced at the beginning of the project during out DTR meeting that I wanted to work on soft skills and he was very understanding throughout the entire project. He not only let me know when I was doing or saying things wrong he gave me specific and actionable tips that let me work on my soft skills while remaining productive the entire time. I left the experience as a better team member and I would not hesitate to work with him again.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave detailed feedback to the members of my Traffic Spy project, and will give feedback for my earmarked project soon.

### Playing a Part

In general I try to give back to the comunnity on a daily basis when I see things that aren't being addressed. Many mornings when I arrive around 8:00-8:15, the dishwashers are covered in dirty dishes from the previous day. I think on an average of about every other day I would unload the clean dishes and load up the dishes on top of the washers. This may seem traiviail but since it was a clear need that wasn't being met I stepped up to the unglamorous task of taking care of it. I also tried to be cognizant of module 1 students that were struggling a little bit with projects here and there. Often when I head out for the night I will take an extra 15 minutes to stop by a pair of 1508 students working at a TV to try to help with whatever they are working on. Especially in the beginning, I made sure that 1508's in my posse and others were set up and knew how to use Pry and Ruby Docs to get the information for the solutions they needed, since in my exerpience "teaching a man to fish" is the most important thing someone can do for you when you are first starting to learn to code.
