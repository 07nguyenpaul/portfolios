# Travis Haby - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module I tried to focus on workflow, using tools, and of course understanding the beast that is Rails. I feel like I really solidified my practice with git, as well as sped up my workflow by using shortcuts in Atom as well as other tools to take some of the mundane aspects of programming away. I am really excited to feel like I understand Rails pretty well. It's cool to see all kinds of error messages and know exactly what file to look in for the next step given the output of the error. Exciting!

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Mike
Challenge: Top Plays

Notes:

* started with tests
* first instinct was to use ActiveRecord rather than Ruby
* created new column and used a callback to populate it so we could use activerecord
instead of the Ruby
* also pushed all logic down to model
* nice skinny controller

Scores:

* Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 4
* Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 4
* Rails Syntax & API: 4
* Rails Style: 3
* Testing: 4
* Collaboration: 4

### Attendance

I attended all days of class with the exception of an excused and communicated abscence on September 11th, when I attended my friend's wedding in Massachusets. Seriously, more weddings? I arrvied at Turing well before 8:30 AM every day of the module.

### Feedback to Me

##### Traffic Spy

###### From Matt:
  I knew that Travis was already a great communicator but throughout project he constantly surprised me with how patient he was. I announced at the beginning of the project during out DTR meeting that I wanted to work on soft skills and he was very understanding throughout the entire project. He not only let me know when I was doing or saying things wrong he gave me specific and actionable tips that let me work on my soft skills while remaining productive the entire time. I left the experience as a better team member and I would not hesitate to work with him again.
  
###### From Adam:
 GOOD: Travis is an all-star! I personally perceive you as one of the strongest communicators in our school. I really admire the soft skills and experience that you have acquired from being a teacher.  Learning new concepts quickly is a strong suit of yours.

I also admire your propensity to follow the spec, conventions, and guidelines set by our teachers. I find this approach the simplest and it is really a nice to have quality when working with somebody on a project

BAD: I became frustrated during our project. I largely felt un-included and un-invited to drive and most conversations occurred ‘around me'. I did try to proceed with caution by sitting between you and Matt and chiming in many times. But I still could tell that project consulting was done between the other members with a ‘you good?’ at the end. The good thing is that you really tried to repair this at the end of the project. I really appreciate that. 

I would really like to pair again sometime. However, I will likely make it a goal to be more direct during our future exchanges.

##### Earmarked (Little Shop of Orders)

###### From Rose:

###### From Mimi:

This was the first time I’ve worked with Travis and after a week plus of pairing, I would happily work with him again. Travis was always willing to take on any task, whether it was small or large. Specifically, we worked together to create an undo method, integrate Stripe, and test some features that neither of us had done before. Travis did not balk at the challenge, but rather jumped at the opportunity to learn something new. Not everyone is adept at navigating unchartered territory, but Travis takes it all in stride while successfully completing the task. I’d happily work with him again!

###### From Bret:

Travis was a pleasure to work with. He was hardworking, reliable, and communicative. He was also patient and organized which kept the group moving forward even during the more trying parts of our project. I also enjoyed pairing with Travis, as he was able to explain complex problems quite effectively. However, the best part about working with Travis was that he was someone I could trust. For example, I could trust that he would write quality code, I could trust that he would deploy our app on time, I could trust that he would finish his assigned tasks on time if not earlier; etc.  Working with someone you could rely on and trust (i.e. Travis) made this project much more enjoyable.

I would work with Travis again and have no comments for improvement… except maybe having a different fantasy team name.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave detailed feedback to the members of my Traffic Spy project, and will give feedback for my earmarked project soon.

### Playing a Part

In general I try to give back to the comunnity on a daily basis when I see things that aren't being addressed. Many mornings when I arrive around 8:00-8:15, the dishwashers are covered in dirty dishes from the previous day. I think on an average of about every other day I would unload the clean dishes and load up the dishes on top of the washers. This may seem traiviail but since it was a clear need that wasn't being met I stepped up to the unglamorous task of taking care of it. I also tried to be cognizant of module 1 students that were struggling a little bit with projects here and there. Often when I head out for the night I will take an extra 15 minutes to stop by a pair of 1508 students working at a TV to try to help with whatever they are working on. Especially in the beginning, I made sure that 1508's in my posse and others were set up and knew how to use Pry and Ruby Docs to get the information for the solutions they needed, since in my exerpience "teaching a man to fish" is the most important thing someone can do for you when you are first starting to learn to code.
