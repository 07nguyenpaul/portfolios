## Community

In general I try to give back to the comunnity on a daily basis when I see things that aren't being addressed. Many mornings when I arrive around 8:00-8:15, the dishwashers are covered in dirty dishes from the previous day. I think on an average of about every other day I would unload the clean dishes and load up the dishes on top of the washers. This may seem traiviail but since it was a clear need that wasn't being met I stepped up to the unglamorous task of taking care of it. I also tried to be cognizant of module 1 students that were struggling a little bit with projects here and there. Often when I head out for the night I will take an extra 15 minutes to stop by a pair of 1508 students working at a TV to try to help with whatever they are working on. Especially in the beginning, I made sure that 1508's in my posse and others were set up and knew how to use Pry and Ruby Docs to get the information for the solutions they needed, since in my exerpience "teaching a man to fish" is the most important thing someone can do for you when you are first starting to learn to code.
