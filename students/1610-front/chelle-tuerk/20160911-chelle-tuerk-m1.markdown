# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals for module 1 include establishing a solid foundation in which to build upon.  I have set out to fully understand the concepts of Javascript and create an environment for myself that promotes success in all areas.  I have been reassured in learning that I, in fact, have found a fervor for programming.
