# Sonia Gupta - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Last module involved some personal issues that required me to repeat Mod 2. My experience at Turing has involved a lot of falling down, crumbling, and then getting back up again. This round was no different. I set out to cement the knowledge I had gleaned last time and I believe I have accomplished that. Even more important, however, is that I set out to build my own resilience and to develop the internal fortitude necessary to soldier on in the face of frequent setbacks. I have been a quitter before, but I vowed that I would not let myself down this time. I can confidently say that I kept that vow, and I intend never to break it again.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

We worked on a number of tutorials this module which gradually tested and increased our knowledge of web applications. We began with Sinatra and finally graduated to Rails. Both frameworks helped to cement our understanding of CRUD functionality.

### Sinatra CRUD - Robot World

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/intro_to_crud.markdown)

Robot World involved creating a Sinatra app from scratch. It involved full CRUD functionality as well as some model functionality.
