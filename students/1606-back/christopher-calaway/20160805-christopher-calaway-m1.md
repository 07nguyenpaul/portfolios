### Areas of Emphasis

Academically, my primary goal when commencing matriculation at Turing was to come in *tabula rasa*, leaving all past experience, expectation, and ego behind, and to completely go "all in" for the Turing method. My hope was that with this approach I would be best prepared to absorb any and all material that would be thrown at us. I also set a goal for myself to not lose sight of the fact that I'm here because I love learning and coding, as well as to maintain an eager curiosity throughout my time here. I am proud to report that I stuck to these goals and it has paid off in spades. In retrospect it's difficult to believe the immense amount of knowledge I have absorbed in just six weeks, and the fact that I've been thoroughly enjoying it as well.

Non-academically, a second goal I set for myself was with regard to self-care. Specifically, my goal was to eat well and sleep enough every day. I'm also glad to report that I have succeeded in both of these endeavors through the duration of the module.

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:
* Menu works
* Gameplay works
* 51 tests all pass
* Tests are overall good
* Implementation is good but gets very complicated in spots
* Watch out for your hard-to-test class attracting functionality
* When conditionals return true/false look to refactor/simplify, esp with a mentor

##### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

###### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

###### 2. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

###### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

###### 4. REPL Interface
* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

###### 5. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* reads and writes
* does 160 characters
* does capitaliation and numbers
* 16 tests total
* has a readme

##### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

###### 1. Overall Functionality
* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

###### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

###### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

###### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

### Being a Community Member

From Angela Lindow__<br />
From the first time I paired with Calaway, I was impressed by his natural talent for logical, algorithmic thinking. He doesn't shy away from difficult questions and is able to find the fun in working towards the solution. His calm, even-keel temperament makes him a pleasure to work with. He is always striving to find not just a solution, but the best solution.```

From __Kinan Whyte:__<br />
Calaway has offered great value to our biggest project this module in many ways. From a mathematical background, he offers a very strong way of looking at problems by holding an immense amount of complexity all at once, yet is able to hold a simple and concise approach to each step. This is an immensely valuable asset. Working with Calaway has been very smooth. He offers a skilled way of articulating abstract concepts in programming and is willing to look at problems through any new or fresh lenses that may be offered to the table. His collaborative skills are on point. He's able to push through difficult problems quickly, but the speed is not overwhelming or overdriven. Rather, the patience, poise, interpersonal communication, and awareness of workflow efficiency, make Calaway stand out so well in a team.

From __Michael Hill:__<br />
Calaway was a great partner on the Nightwriter project.  His attitude and approach to tackling difficult concepts was eye opening.  The more difficult the concept the more he seemed to enjoy it and push through to find the solution. His enthusiasm was encouraging and helped keep us on track through every step of project. His work ethic as well as his team first attitude make him ideal to pair with.  Hopefully we will get the chance to work together again in the future.

From Dan Broadbent:__<br />
Calaway was a pleasure to work with on the Nightwriter project.  He was enthusiastic about the work we were doing and went above and beyond to make sure that we met all the base requirements on time.  We all had a great experience with this project because we did a thorough job defining the relationship, and everyone followed through with what was expected of them.

From Chase Dunagan:__<br />
Calaway is an amazing piece of the Mod-1 puzzle.  He is kind to everyone and his calm demeanor is contagious when interacting and pairing with him, which makes it easier to assess the problem at hand.  Whenever I go to Calaway with a question, he doesnâ€™t hesitate to drop what he is doing, and mull over my problem with me.  He is exactly the type of intelligent, kind, and inclusive student that Turing hopes to attract.  And I look forward to working with him throughout my time at Turing.

### Playing a Part

During Module 1 I have attended all Turing functions, such as guest speakers, lightning talks, meet & greets, alumni homecoming, et cetera. I have also made it a point to go the extra mile to try to raise morale among my peers with lavish enthusiasm, positive feedback, and high-fives during stressful study times.

I am excited to report that I have coordinated with Matthew Campbell and have volunteered to take over organizing the Mod 2 >> Mod 1 pairing schedule. I truly appreciate the assistance they have offered us and I have been eagerly anticipating the day that I will be in a position to help out the next generation of Turing students. I believe my love of learning and teaching, my talent for organizing community functions, and my ability to communicate things in a clear and consice mannor will make me well suited to take over this position.
