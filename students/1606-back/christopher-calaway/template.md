### Areas of Emphasis

Academically, my primary goal when joining Turing was to come in *tabula rasa*, leaving all past experience, expectation, and ego behind, and to completely go "all in" for the Turing method. My hope was that with this mentality I would be best prepared to absorb any and all material that would be thrown at us.

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
