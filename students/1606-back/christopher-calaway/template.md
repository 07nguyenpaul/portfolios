### Areas of Emphasis

Academically, my primary goal when joining Turing was to come in *tabula rasa*, leaving all past experience, expectation, and ego behind, and to completely go "all in" for the Turing method. My hope was that with this mentality I would be best prepared to absorb any and all material that would be thrown at us.

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

### End of Module Assessment

###### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
* 4: Developer is able to write Ruby with a minimum of reference or debugging

###### 2. Completion and Progress
* 4: Developer fully completes baseline assignment and one of the Challenge options.

###### 3. Testing
* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification

###### 4. Workflow
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

###### 5. Collaboration
* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

###### 6. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:
* Looking at flashcards
* 24 tests that all pass
* Tests are easy to understand, test many contrapositives
* Implementation is clean and straightforward

##### Evaluation Rubric

###### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

###### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

###### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

###### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:
* Menu works
* Gameplay works
* 51 tests all pass
* Tests are overall good
* Implementation is good but gets very complicated in spots
* Watch out for your hard-to-test class attracting functionality
* When conditionals return true/false look to refactor/simplify, esp with a mentor

##### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

###### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

###### 2. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

###### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

###### 4. REPL Interface
* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

###### 5. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
