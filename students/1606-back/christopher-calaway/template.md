# Calaway - M1 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Academically, my primary goal when joining Turing was to come in *tabula rasa*, leaving all past experience, expectation, and ego behind, and to completely go "all in" for the Turing method. My hope was that with this mentality I would be best prepared to absorb any and all material that would be thrown at us.

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

### End of Module Assessment

###### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
* 4: Developer is able to write Ruby with a minimum of reference or debugging

###### 2. Completion and Progress
* 4: Developer fully completes baseline assignment and one of the Challenge options.

###### 3. Testing
* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification

###### 4. Workflow
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

###### 5. Collaboration
* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

###### 6. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:
* Looking at flashcards
* 24 tests that all pass
* Tests are easy to understand, test many contrapositives
* Implementation is clean and straightforward

##### Evaluation Rubric

###### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

###### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

###### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

###### 5. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### Battleship

Assessed By: Jeff

Notes:
* Menu works
* Gameplay works
* 51 tests all pass
* Tests are overall good
* Implementation is good but gets very complicated in spots
* Watch out for your hard-to-test class attracting functionality
* When conditionals return true/false look to refactor/simplify, esp with a mentor

##### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

###### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

###### 2. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

###### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

###### 4. REPL Interface
* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

###### 5. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* reads and writes
* does 160 characters
* does capitaliation and numbers
* 16 tests total
* has a readme

##### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

###### 1. Overall Functionality
* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

###### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

###### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

###### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

### Being a Community Member

From __Kinan Whyte:__
Calaway has offered great value to our biggest project this module in many ways. From a mathematical background, he offers a very strong way of looking at problems by holding an immense amount of complexity all at once, yet is able to hold a simple and concise approach to each step. This is an immensely valuable asset. Working with Calaway has been very smooth. He offers a skilled way of articulating abstract concepts in programming and is willing to look at problems through any new or fresh lenses that may be offered to the table. His collaborative skills are on point. He's able to push through difficult problems quickly, but the speed is not overwhelming or overdriven. Rather, the patience, poise, interpersonal communication, and awareness of workflow efficiency, make Calaway stand out so well in a team.
