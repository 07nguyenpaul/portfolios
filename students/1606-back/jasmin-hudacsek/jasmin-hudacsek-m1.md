### Areas of Emphasis

With some prior knowledge of Ruby and general programming before Turing, I hope to have a firmer grasp of Ruby fundementals in order to make complete and functioning programs. I also wish to better understand object-oriented programming and the best practices that go along with working with OOP. I hope to learn as much as I can from instructors, mentors, and other students while I'm here.

Getting to meet some Turing alums before starting the program has made me fully aware that this will be the some of the hardest seven months of my life but also the most rewarding. I am both excited and nervous about making the commitment, but I know I will only become better for pulling through.

### End of Module Assessment

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to write Ruby with a minimum of reference or debugging

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

#### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Work

(Intro)

### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/j-sm-n/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

In this project, you'll write a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* Well tested, but could use some additional cases
* Great UI experience with Runner
* Some opportunities to refactor
* Look at ways to use calculated values instead of storing things in ivars
* two extensions

#### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality *as well as* two extensions.

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring.

##### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/j-sm-n/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

In this project you'll use Ruby to build an implementation of the classic game Battleship.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* It runs, but hangs at ship placement.
* Gots some class inheritance
* 48 tests
* sweet sweet namespacing
* good use constants
* AI approach is interesting.

#### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

##### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

##### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

##### 4. REPL Interface

* 1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult

##### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

### Projects

(Intro)

### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/susiirwin/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon's army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille's development of his Braille tactile writing system.

In this project we'll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* Only converts to braille
* 10 tests
* Really clean code
* Braille to english does not write
* Some opportunities to refactor to improve testing by sending arguments as opposed to methods modifying ivars.
* Would like to see more edge cases in testing.
* Really like how you broke out the dictionary to a separate file and used constants
* Follows SRP exceptionally well, everything only does the one thing.

#### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

##### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

##### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
