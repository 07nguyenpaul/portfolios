### Areas of Emphasis

With some prior knowledge of Ruby and general programming before Turing, I hope to have a firmer grasp of Ruby fundementals in order to make complete and functioning programs. I also wish to better understand object-oriented programming and the best practices that go along with working with OOP. I hope to learn as much as I can from instructors, mentors, and other students while I'm here.

Getting to meet some Turing alums before starting the program has made me fully aware that this will be the some of the hardest seven months of my life but also the most rewarding. I am both excited and nervous about making the commitment, but I know I will only become better for pulling through.

### End of Module Assessment

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to write Ruby with a minimum of reference or debugging

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

#### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

---

### Work

> Projects from Module 1 teach the fundamentals of Ruby syntax. They became progressively more difficult but introduced new TDD and Agile development goals as the module progressed.

### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/j-sm-n/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

>__Flashcards__ is a project that establishes an understanding of OOP and how objects can interact. The concepts of flashcards, a deck, and a round are used to show the capabilities of OOP.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* Well tested, but could use some additional cases
* Great UI experience with Runner
* Some opportunities to refactor
* Look at ways to use calculated values instead of storing things in ivars
* two extensions

#### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

##### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality *as well as* two extensions.

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring.

##### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/j-sm-n/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

>__Battleship__ is a project that enforces breaking a program up into logical components and implementing a useable REPL interface. In this project, Ruby is used to build an implementation of the classic game Battleship.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* It runs, but hangs at ship placement.
* Gots some class inheritance
* 48 tests
* sweet sweet namespacing
* good use constants
* AI approach is interesting.

#### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

##### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

##### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

##### 4. REPL Interface

* 1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult

##### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

## Team

### Projects

> Paired projects in Module 1 focused on Git Workflow, pair programming methodologies and became increasingly more complex by the addition of parsing large CSV files.

### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/susiirwin/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

> The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon's army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille's development of his Braille tactile writing system.

> In this project, systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse will be implemented.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* Only converts to braille
* 10 tests
* Really clean code
* Braille to english does not write
* Some opportunities to refactor to improve testing by sending arguments as opposed to methods modifying ivars.
* Would like to see more edge cases in testing.
* Really like how you broke out the dictionary to a separate file and used constants
* Follows SRP exceptionally well, everything only does the one thing.

#### Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

##### 1. Overall Functionality

* 2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

##### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

> From Susi Irwin: "Jasmin was an absolute delight to partner with on Night Writer. Her strong organizational skills and motivated attitude pushed us forward at a fantastic rate. Jasmin is easy to communicate with in person, as well as remotely. I was excited to be paired with her for our first paired project and was not disappointed. She has an innate ability to calm nerves and logically look at the issues as they are presented. Jasmin was able to keep our motivation alive even when we hit bumps in the road. Her enthusiasm and charisma are absolutely wonderful!"

### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/j-sm-n/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

> __Black Thuesday__ is a project that focuses on using tests that both drive design and implementation of code, decomposes a large application into small components, connects related objects together through references and relies on an agile approach to building software.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

From Gabi Procell: "I am always astounded at Jasmin's organizational skills as well as how much cool information that she provides to the Turing community. I'm not quite sure where she finds time for it all, but she seems to fit in so much community time in addition to her work time -- and that completely amazes me. I also appreciate how she stepped up to be a representative for our cohort in the SAB. You're an amazing organization queen!"

### Playing a Part

* I actively participated in Student Advisory Board and tried to stress the importance of SAB to my cohort so that they could effectively make use of the resource early on.

* Attempted to help my cohort tackle effective project management by showing them Trello and task management methodologies.

* Actively participated within Joan Clarke Society and outside-Turing events focused toward Women and POC in Tech.

* Tried to re-arrange the Big Workspace at the end of every Friday so it was back to normal and ready to go for Monday (or the folks camping out over the weekend).
