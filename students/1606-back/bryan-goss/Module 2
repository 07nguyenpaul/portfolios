#Area of Emphasis

Unlike mod 1, I haven't used most of the tools that we encountered in mod 2. My area of emphasis has been to maintain a healthy balance between learning web development with Sinatra and Rails, along with picking up some machine learning from my time with Amrstrong posse.

#End of Module Assessment.
Sal and I were able to finish the two questions within the time limit. I received mostly 3's and some 4's. The main thing I should improve is to take smaller steps while coding. Write one test, and then one part of the code. Also, I let my experience with SQL bog me down when using active record associations. I can work on drilling active record methods more to alivieate that. Finally, Sal noticed that I laid out some options and asked him for his opinion about them, but suggested I continue to focus on improving my collaborative skills.

I consider my main contribution to the community to be my work with Armstrong posse. Machine learning is a difficult topic and requires a good foundation of knowledge. I've noticed the posse struggle two modules in a row to help new members establish this baseline. To help remedy this, I worked with Jean and Erin to develop a light "curriculum" I hope will help people get more out of their time with the posse.

Other:
For the first Friday Spike, I talked with some mod 1 students with Ben and we tried to help them settle in and get used to some of the tools they'll be using while they're here. Throughout the module I paired with Mod 1 students X times, particularly Brandon and Dan.
