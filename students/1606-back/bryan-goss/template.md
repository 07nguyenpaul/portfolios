# Bryan Goss - M1 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

As someone with experience programming, my focus was to improve my style and workflow, and to make myself available to other students in my cohort. 

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Challenge: "What Can I Make?"

Notes:

Led with tests, identified two tests that will verify functionality needed
Weighed creating Hash with default value versus responding differently (with if/else) if key doesn't exist
Niiice job talking through thought process, engaging assessor to weigh value of different approaches
Used mock in "What Can I Make" extension
Anticipated test results - good
Could do more to run tests incrementally
1. Ruby Syntax & API  
4: Developer is able to write Ruby with a minimum of reference or debugging

2. Completion and Progress  
3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

3. Testing  
3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

4. Workflow  
4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

5. Collaboration  
4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

6. Enumerable & Collections  
4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Ben Pepper: 

>You are doing fine. You understand the syntax and the theory. I think you can learn to demonstrate your understanding of code better. Right now you read the method names and variables as you come across them. Try to take a moment to comprehend what each line is doing and explain the purpose rather than the process. You were very productive during this project and did most of the work for setting up classes and repos.

Feedback to Jean: 

>You definitely know what you’re doing. You have a really good brain for figuring out the algorithms that make a program work. I would suggest taking more time to understand the spec before you get to work. In Paramorse, when I got your code, the Queue class was working as a Stack (the #pop method was removing the last item instead of the first item) which illustrates what can happen if you don’t put in the effort to really understand the spec. Also, your testing is incredibly thorough, I look forward to your Friday Spike about testing like a scientist.


### Being a Community Member

From Gabi Procell:

>From day one, Bryan has always offered his assistance to anyone in our cohort. His ability to balance his learning with helping his peers and maintain a great attitude is amazing. He has also shown great motivation in helping others learn by coordinating student-led sessions within our cohort. Great job, Goss! 

From Ben Pepper: 

>You’re a fantastic partner.  You are always willing to slow down and help make sure I understood what was going on.  You are thoughtful in your word choice and making sure people are comfortable.  Don’t have to apologize so much.  Nights where you didn’t do anything are completely fine.  Turing will take a lot out of you so taking a night off here and there is fine.  Don’t burn yourself out.  You’re a natural leader with great qualities.  I’m betting when you apologize most of the time its to things people didn’t think twice about.

### Playing a Part

As a new comer, I wanted to be helpful without coming across as a know-it-all. I led a Friday Spike about using Mocks, along with Jean and Jesse. About 8 people attended and Brian H. told me he got a lot out of it. His feedback was to try the "I do, we do, you do" method of demonstration next time. 

During the Complete-me, I helped David understand recursion. After staying late to talk it over he said something clicked and he was able to make a lot of progress on the project. At last week's retro, Jesse thanked me for being "generous with my time."
