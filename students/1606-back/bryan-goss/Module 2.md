#Bryan Goss - M2 Portfolio

##Area of Emphasis

Unlike mod 1, I haven't used most of the tools that we encountered in mod 2. My area of emphasis has been to maintain a healthy balance between learning web development with Sinatra and Rails, along with picking up some machine learning from my time with Amrstrong posse. 

End of Mod assessment: 3  
Individual work: 3

##End of Module Assessment.

Sal and I were able to finish the two questions within the time limit. I received mostly 3's and some 4's. The main thing I should improve is to take smaller steps while coding. Write one test, and then one part of the code. Also, I let my experience with SQL bog me down when using active record associations. I can work on drilling active record methods more to alivieate that. Finally, Sal noticed that I laid out some options and asked him for his opinion about them, but suggested I continue to focus on improving my collaborative skills. 

#Individual work

##Robot World

Robot world was very helpful for practicing the different steps required to make a CRUD application.

##Mix Master

Mix Master was a lot of fun to work on. I solidified my understanding of relationships and I also learned about authenticating users with an outside source, Spotify in this case. Setting up Heroku and getting the Spotify API to work together with it was challenging. The API worked locally, but not on the Heroku site.

##Rails Mini project - Points Box

I was ill during the Mini-project and I regret that I didn't make more progress. It was a good experience for trying to implemtn Authentication and Authroization.

#Group work

##Rush hour

Rush hour was a difficult project. There was a lot to do in the timline. My group worked well for the most part, but there were a challenging points. AT this point I was struggling with active record associations. I am too accustomed to thinking in SQL, but Active Record handles most of that for us.

##Little Shop

My favorite project this module. I really enjoyed the project management parts. Getting new cards to work on every few days seems very realistic. My team worked very well together, I look forward to working with Brian and Chase in the future.

#Professional skills

##Technical Blog Post

##Lightning talk

I gave a talk about how AI and automation is making our job easier, and potentially so easy that devlopers may not always have a job.

#Gear Up
##Getting better at difficult things

As gear ups go, this one seemed extremely relevant to my daily life at Turing. The main take away is that the best way to get better at something is repetition with some kind of feedback to check your work. If you're just practicing in isolation, there's no way to know if you're improving, so feedback is important. Even skills which are difficult or impossible to describe to someone are teachable with this process. 

##There is an I in team

Setting boundaries is important. I would love to live in a world where people were as explicity about their boundaries as the person in the video was describing. I will definitely incorporate this into my future DTRs.

##CODE Debugging the gender gap

I joined the conversation of people who want to be contientious of gender issues and take action to improve things. We talked about making diversity "everone's job" rather than having a single "diversity champion" on the team. The difference between male experiences and female experiences in the tech industry surprised some people, but I have been paying attention to these issues for a while and I am definitely aware of how the industry as a whole can make women feel unwelcome.

#Professional Development 
##Finding Opportunities

The skills in this lesson focused on how to investigate companies and learn what they do and what they're looking for. I want to spend some time during intermission week looking at Linkedin, twitter, github and other sources to find out as much about a company or some individuals at those companies as I can. When I find an interesting company I should contact someone who works there and ask to talk about what they do and how they like it.

##Collaborative Communication

The difference between Impact and Intent is frustrating for me, I almost always have good intentions, but I don't always have the impact I want to have. Impact often feels beyond my controll, but by using facts more than opinions or assumptions, I think I can have the impact I want to have.

##Networking with Lia

I appreciated the chance to practice my 2 minute story. I got good feedback from the people I talked to and it was cool to hear how people describe themselves. I need to do more work to find meetups and networking events to practice these skills.

#Feedback and Community Participation

##Giving Feedback

Feedback to Nate after Rush Hour - 

    I felt very comfortable being on a team with you. You worked diligently and helped keep things moving. You helped to set clear expectations at the end of each session about what we should do separately and have ready for next time.
    I can think of a couple times where I don't know your opinions or thoughts. Part of that is definitely because I talk too much. In addition to that, I think you could offer your opinions more.  Some times I felt like Susi and I were talking a lot and you let yourself take a back seat. On the other hand, I think you were the most centered member of the group and I appreciate that you worked well with Susi and me even when we were not as calm and focused as we could have been. Thanks for all your work on this project, it was a very positive experience! 

Feedback to Susi after Rush Hour - 

    I really appreciate the way you kept us all on task and organized. Our waffle board was always in good shape, and you were often the one who suggested switching roles (driver/navigator). As I said in retro, I think you’ll benefit a lot from saying out loud what you expect a given change to do. A good example is rake db:test:prepare. What does it do and why do you use it? Near the end of our project it became a ritual that, as far as I could see, you didn’t really understand. We’re all here to learn and recognizing that feeling of not understanding is a good opportunity to learn something. Another thing I really liked was the way you took ownership of the migrations. I love the way our database looks and you seem to have really mastered all the skills that go into setting it up.

##Being a community member

Feedback from Nate after Rush Hour - 

    Bryan was a great partner. The knowledge he brought to the project was a driving force and he always took the time to explain things that were a possibly a little unclear to me. He is very dedicated to doing things efficiently and making decisions that will benefit the flexibility of the project in the short as well as the long term. I think he could benefit from a little more patience when encountering differing viewpoints but overall he was a great pleasure to work with

Feedback from Susi after Rush Hour - 

    I am so thankful I was able to ask you questions when I didn’t understand what was happening. You are very dedicated to the project and to the team and that really shows in your intensity and determination.  To be perfectly honest I was really intimidated when I heard we were going to be on the same team; you have such an amazing handle on the code and databases that it can be a bit overwhelming.  What I realized was that having you as a team member is great! You have the ability to explain areas that were confusing to me. I would urge you to not put so much pressure on yourself to be done first, or compare the status of one groups’s project to the one you are working on. Keep staying dedicated and passionate and keep up that sense of humor! The laughs you created were incredible. Watching you work through SQL statements was great; your thought process and process of elimination is commendable.

Also, after the Collaborative Communication work shop with Allison, I spoke directly to Susi because I thought she might have been unhappy with some of our interactions during the project. She told me she thought I tried too teach rather than collaborate. She suggested I observe Pat Wentz, one of her favorite people to pair with, while he pairs with someone. I scheduled some time to do this, but then I became ill and couldn't make it.

##Playing a part
I consider my main contribution to the community to be my work with Armstrong posse. Machine learning is a difficult topic and requires a good foundation of knowledge. I've noticed the posse struggle two modules in a row to help new members establish this baseline. To help remedy this, I worked with Jean and Erin to develop a light "curriculum" I hope will help people get more out of their time with the posse.

Other:
For the first Friday Spike, I talked with some mod 1 students with Ben and we tried to help them settle in and get used to some of the tools they'll be using while they're here. Throughout the module I paired with Mod 1 students 4 times, particularly Brandon Randall, Dave Junta and Dan Olsen. The last Friday I will help with the Conway Game of Life coding challenge.
