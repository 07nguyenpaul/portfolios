### Areas of Emphasis

This module I am setting the goal for myself to really understand HTML and CSS as well as Rails. I want to be able to be a contributing successful member of my cohort and of group projects. I would like to work on my confidence in coding and develop more of an instinct to know what to try and do as I move forward. I want to be able to leave this module feeling like I have a solid understanding of the concepts presented to me. In my posse (Pahlka), I will be a more active member workong on the technology side of things. I will be a leader of the imposter lunch series. I will be a successful pair to the members of 1608-BE and comtinue to develop my pairing skills with my cohort-mates. I want to be a positive influence on and member of the Turing Community.

#####Feedback to Me

* from Nate Anderson: "You made me smile on a daily basis and definitely helped make everything lighter in some of the more tense moments of the project. The organization you displayed kept our team going in the right direction and made our workflow that much more smooth and easy. The analytics tables in the views were a work of art and added some aesthetic flare to the project that I would not have been able to do. I would like to see a little more confidence in your knowledge as you added a lot to the project, but that is something I believe will come with time and experience. Overall, wonderful partner and I really enjoyed working with you."
* from Bryan Goss: "I really appreciate the way you kept us all on task and organized. Our waffle board was always in good shape, and you were often the one who suggested switching roles (driver/navigator). As I said in retro, I think you’ll benefit a lot from saying out loud what you expect a given change to do. A good example is rake db:test:prepare. What does it do and why do you use it? Near the end of our project it became a ritual that, as far as I could see, you didn’t really understand. We’re all here to learn and recognizing that feeling of not understanding is a good opportunity to learn something. Another thing I really liked was the way you took ownership of the migrations. I love the way our database looks and you seem to have really mastered all the skills that go into setting it up."

### Giving Feedback

* Bryan Goss - "I am so thankful I was able to ask you questions when I didn’t understand what was happening. You are very dedicated to the project and to the team and that really shows in your intensity and determination.  To be perfectly honest I was really intimidated when I heard we were going to be on the same team; you have such an amazing handle on the code and databases that it can be a bit overwhelming.  What I realized was that having you as a team member is great! You have the ability to explain areas that were confusing to me. I would urge you to not put so much pressure on yourself to be done first, or compare the status of one groups’s project to the one you are working on. Keep staying dedicated and passionate and keep up that sense of humor! The laughs you created were incredible. Watching you work through SQL statements was great; your thought process and process of elimination is commendable."
* Nate Anderson - "Your calm demeanor and analytical thought process made this project way more enjoyable to work on. You were always there to cheer us on, say positive recognition, and make sure that we kept the end goal in mind. Your Iteration 2 method work was a HUGE breakthrough for our team and our project and seeing you smile when you figured out the rankings of top 3 items was awesome. In the future, I would love to hear you speak up even more and really get your thoughts on the tough spots."
