# Susi Irwin- M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I really want to work on my confidence level in and with my coding. I want to work on my confidence in experimenting within my code while I am working and really using my tests and errors to drive my Development. A side goal has been to really work on my typing as well; improving my typing will not only boost my confidence as a software developer, but also increase my efficiency and productivity levels. I set a goal for myself at the end of Module 1 to not put unrealistic pressure on myself and instead use my passion and drive as motivation to really learn the material and apply it to my work. I feel that after 6 weeks in Module 2 I have come leaps and bounds from where I was in Module 1.

This module I am setting the goal for myself to really understand HTML and CSS as well as Rails. I want to be able to be a contributing successful member of my cohort and of group projects. I would like to work on my confidence in coding and develop more of an instinct to know what to try and do as I move forward. I want to be able to leave this module feeling like I have a solid understanding of the concepts presented to me. In my posse (Pahlka), I will be a more active member working on the technology side of things. I will be a leader of the imposter lunch series. I will be a successful pair to the members of 1608-BE and continue to develop my pairing skills with my cohort-mates. I want to be a positive influence on and member of the Turing Community.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This module was extremely saturated with challenging solo projects and side work. Each day we would learn between one and three new ideas, theories, or concepts and be expected to implement them as soon as that evening in an assignment. Not all of my projects are complete, but I did my absolute best to follow the specs, ask questions, and work thoroughly on my code.

#### Robot World

* [GitHub URL]()
* [Original Assignment]()

Robot World was my first real attempt at a Sinatra Application. It was a complicated project because not only was I developing a web application on Sinatra for the first time, I was also working with a database for the first time. Starting with a YML file, I was able to build out our robots in the application. After a few days, the challenge was to convert that YML to a SQL database; this was both challenging and amazing! The SQL commands proved to be extremely powerful. I was pleased that I took on the challenge of performing calculations with SQL queries instead of raw Ruby code. I was also able to implement Bootstrap to make a visually appealing website with clean layouts and formatted tables.

From Nate Andersen: "You made me smile on a daily basis and definitely helped make everything lighter in some of the more tense moments of the project. The organization you displayed kept our team going in the right direction and made our workflow that much more smooth and easy. The analytics tables in the views were a work of art and added some aesthetic flare to the project that I would not have been able to do. I would like to see a little more confidence in your knowledge as you added a lot to the project, but that is something I believe will come with time and experience. Overall, wonderful partner and I really enjoyed working with you."

From Bryan Goss: "I really appreciate the way you kept us all on task and organized. Our waffle board was always in good shape, and you were often the one who suggested switching roles (driver/navigator). As I said in retro, I think you’ll benefit a lot from saying out loud what you expect a given change to do. A good example is rake db:test:prepare. What does it do and why do you use it? Near the end of our project it became a ritual that, as far as I could see, you didn’t really understand. We’re all here to learn and recognizing that feeling of not understanding is a good opportunity to learn something. Another thing I really liked was the way you took ownership of the migrations. I love the way our database looks and you seem to have really mastered all the skills that go into setting it up.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

This session was incredibly informative. Lia walked us through the proper setups for all of our social media accounts as well as our professional accounts. She was able to give us tips and advice for having effective, truthful. and rich descriptions within our profiles. She encouraged us to really put the thought and effort that is necessary into these profiles as well; these accounts and profiles can really help propel us forward and we need to take them seriously.

#### Collaboration Communication with Allison

1. Details on project management strategies you used in your projects (Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?

  In Rush Hour the team I worked with used an approach that was a hybrid of waterfall and agile, with emphasis on agile. We did not utilize our Waffle as much as I had hoped, but we did make a solid attempt. The Project Spec was our main source for user stories and tasks. This project was very difficult to divide and conquer so the three of us worked together most of the time. Due to this three person work sessions, we were able to really move through the spec sheet as one team. Our communication was decent, but at times was fairly surface deep. We were not as specific in our feedback as we should have been and this caused some tension. We learned from our feedback session with Allison afterwards that more specific feedback would have been extremely beneficial to the team's communication and mood.

  For Little Shop, we used a fairly strict agile workflow and this really worked out well. We also made a solid effort, and succeeded, in putting comments into GitHub and taking each other within those comments.

2. How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.

  I have used this feedback in many ways. One thing I have done is started asking even more questions if I am unclear of why a teammate, partner, cohort-mate is doing something that I just do not understand. I have become a bit more assertive in my approach to people as well and have started offering more detailed feedback which includes clear examples for that person. I have learned that I am a bit too quiet when I am unclear during a project and have started to change that by vocalizing my concerns and questions. I have also started to experiment more with my code by using Pry and ByeBug more frequently.

#### Networking with Lia

This was one of my favorite sessions of the series. It was amazing to practice our networking skills with cohort-mates. I recieved some truly great feedback on my story and have already worked on it quite a bit. It was a really encouraging session and Lia really energized the class with her anecdotes and advice. She made me feel like I was on a great path moving forward and that I could network easily and naturally. She offered us some great tips on how to keep conversations flowing naturally and easily as well as great ways to end conversations.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Nate Andersen: "Your calm demeanor and analytical thought process made this project way more enjoyable to work on. You were always there to cheer us on, say positive recognition, and make sure that we kept the end goal in mind. Your Iteration 2 method work was a HUGE breakthrough for our team and our project and seeing you smile when you figured out the rankings of top 3 items was awesome. In the future, I would love to hear you speak up even more and really get your thoughts on the tough spots."

To Bryan Goss: "I am so thankful I was able to ask you questions when I didn’t understand what was happening. You are very dedicated to the project and to the team and that really shows in your intensity and determination.  To be perfectly honest I was really intimidated when I heard we were going to be on the same team; you have such an amazing handle on the code and databases that it can be a bit overwhelming.  What I realized was that having you as a team member is great! You have the ability to explain areas that were confusing to me. I would urge you to not put so much pressure on yourself to be done first, or compare the status of one groups’s project to the one you are working on. Keep staying dedicated and passionate and keep up that sense of humor! The laughs you created were incredible. Watching you work through SQL statements was great; your thought process and process of elimination is commendable."

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

This Module was a very busy one for me. I stepped up in the Pahlka Posse and took over the Student Support Survey each week where Posse members can ask for an extra pairing. This has been extremely interesting for me and has given me a huge opportunity to really get to know the members of my posse and our Mentors better. I, along with Andy Young of 1606-FE have taken over running the Imposter Lunch sessions on Wednesdays. I learned so much from being a member of this group in my first Module that I wanted to step up and help other students as well. This has been extremely challenging and also extremely rewarding. I have enjoyed this weekly get together very much and look forward to continuing it throughout my time at Turing. I volunteered to help with updating the student, staff, and faculty photos this module. Kris Sparks has been working on this and asked for some assistance. It was a bigger job than I anticipated but the rewards were even larger; I learned the names of almost every single Module 1 student in both programs. It was incredible. I took the feedback I received from Jeff in my Module 1 assessment to pair with Kerry Sheldon weekly on professional skills, communication skills, and soft skills. She and I met every Friday morning for about 45 minutes to talk about the areas in my non-coding realm of learning. I also met with a student weekly who took time off between Module 1 and repeating Module 1. We spoke about the work he was doing outside of Turing to prepare him for repeating the Module. We had many discussions about strengths and weaknesses for both of us and strategies for dealing with the stress of Turing. I was able to show him how I was applying what I had learned in Module 1 to my Module 2 work and where I was pushing myself further in this module than I expected. I attended every guest speaker session this module and also helped to rearrange the room for those sessions each week. This module I volunteered to be a Pre-Work Guide for an incoming 1610BE student. It has been really great to be on the other side of that pair and be able to offer some advice and help to an incoming student. I have really enjoyed it and hope to do it again next module.
