### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module, the main thing I wanted to accomplish was to become comfortable enough with ruby that I would have some idea of where to start on most problems. As the module continued and I had a few project evaluations, I realized that, while figuring out where to start was important, I really needed to learn how to continue in a clean, logical way. I struggled a little bit with TDD and encapsulation, but I feel like with each project I improved slightly and I finally felt comfortable with those skills by the final project.

### Work

Every time I finished a project this module, I thought that I had finally figured out what I was doing and that the next project would surely be easier for me. Every time I was wrong.

#### Robodoku

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/robodoku)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/robodoku.markdown)

In this one week project, I wrote a program that parses text as a sudoku puzzle and applies several solving techniques to solve easy puzzles. I struggled with storing my data and accessing it where I wanted to, but trying a ton of different things really taught me a ton about what ruby can do.

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

In this one week project, I wrote a program that stores the dictionary in a trie and returns all the words in that trie that match a string. I used a stupid, stupid chain of eval statements to insert the data, which I found extremely fickle and tricky to do correctly. It was evaluated by Mike with the following results:

* Spec harness passes, 41s.
* Uses some metaprogramming like ideas in order to insert
* Good out of the box thinking
* Would like to have seen a Trie class to abstract out a number of functions that are all in completeme
* Because of that completeme is a bit long
* But there are a good number of ideas broken out into small chunks.

Scores
  + Functional Expectations: 3
  + Test-Driven Development: 3
  + Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
  + Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
  + Enumerable & Collections: 3

#### Paramorse

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/paramorse_redux)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/paramorse.markdown)

In this one week project, I wrote a program that encodes and decodes files from morse code that has been translated into binary. It did not successfully meet the spec of implementing parallel encoding and decoding, but it was able to decode a stream of data in real time. It was evaluated by Mike with the following results: 

* I7 partially complete.
* Tests could use some more edge cases,
* testing in general only covers bare minimum data
* There is a good amount of repetition and redundancy in code

Scores
  + Overall Functionality: 2
  + Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
  + Test-Driven Development: 3
  + Breaking Logic into Components: 2

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

In this one week project, I wrote a program that allows the user to play a game of battlship against the computer via a command-line REPL. This was the first project that I really made good use of object-oriented programming, but communicating information between classes was a definitely a struggle. It was evaluated by Mike with the following results:

* Game works
* 42 tests, 34 of which fail
* Really great use of a cell clas
* Good logic throughout
* Some opportunities to refactor with predicate methods.

Scores
  + Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
  + Enumerable & Collections: 3
  + Test-Driven Development: 2
  + REPL Interface: 3
  + Breaking Logic into Components: 2

## Team

### Projects

Working in a pair on Black Thursday really helped me figure out how to organize my thoughts and write code with best practices. Now that I know how easily the project has been going after starting with a really clean, well-tested base, I think that I will be more vigilant about keeping these practices going in individual work too.

#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

In this two week project, Brian Heim and I wrote a program that reads data from a number of CSV files and returns business intelligence and analytics on that data.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Raphael Barbo: Raphael's enthusiasm and willingness to help with any problem set an amazing example for the rest of the cohort. Also, inheriting Raphael's code in Paramorse provided me with an epiphany as to what clean code should look like. I didn't work with Raphael much, but his positive energy helped me push through a lot of frusturation and doubt.

Brian Heim: Working with Brian on Black Thursday was a great experience. I was amazed by his ability to communicate ideas clearly and keep our understanding of the project straight. Before working with Brian, I hadn't done much pairing, but we wound up pairing about half of the time on this project. It went really well, thanks to Brian's friendly demeanor, strong communication, and persistance. The only thing I would recommend that he work on is developing a more efficient workflow and figuring out how to more quickly get code from his head on to the screen.

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

* Miyamoto Posse: I attended weekly meetings and worked through some Unity tutorials with the goal of helping the posse put together a game by the end of next module.
* I did the readings for Hack Design and participated in several of the weekly discussions.
* I hung around Turing until about 7 most evenings and made myself available to help with problems people were running in to.
* I unloaded and loaded the dishwashers ~10 times throughout the module.
