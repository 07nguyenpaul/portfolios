### Work

(Intro)

#### Robodoku

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/robodoku)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/robodoku.markdown)

In this one week project, I wrote a program that parses text as a sudoku puzzle and applies several solving techniques to solve easy puzzles.

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

In this one week project, I wrote a program that stores the dictionary in a trie and returns all the words in that trie that match a string. It was evaluated by Mike with the following results:

* Spec harness passes, 41s.
* Uses some metaprogramming like ideas in order to insert
* Good out of the box thinking
* Would like to have seen a Trie class to abstract out a number of functions that are all in completeme
* Because of that completeme is a bit long
* But there are a good number of ideas broken out into small chunks.
  + Functional Expectations: 3
  + Test-Driven Development: 3
  + Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 3
  + Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
  + Enumerable & Collections: 3

#### Paramorse

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/paramorse_redux)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/paramorse.markdown)

In this one week project, I wrote a program that encodes and decodes files from morse code that has been translated into binary. It did not successfully meet the spec of implementing parallel encoding and decoding, but it was able to decode a stream of data in real time. It was evaluated by Mike with the following results: 

* I7 partially complete.
* Tests could use some more edge cases,
* testing in general only covers bare minimum data
* There is a good amount of repetition and redundancy in code
  + Overall Functionality: 2
  + Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
  + Test-Driven Development: 3
  + Breaking Logic into Components: 2

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

In this one week project, I wrote a program that allows the user to play a game of battlship against the computer via a command-line REPL. It was evaluated by Mike with the following results:

* Game works
* 42 tests, 34 of which fail
* Really great use of a cell clas
* Good logic throughout
* Some opportunities to refactor with predicate methods.
  + Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
  + Enumerable & Collections: 3
  + Test-Driven Development: 2
  + REPL Interface: 3
  + Breaking Logic into Components: 2

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

In this two week project, Brian Heim and I wrote a program that reads data from a number of CSV files and returns business intelligence and analytics on that data.
