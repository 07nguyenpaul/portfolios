# Ben Pepper - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module for me is intended to be more about focusing on what is happening then trying to keep my feet under me. I don't want to get to a point where I am panicked about the work load or the info. So if that means taking more time with the material thats what has to happen. If I get 3's on everything thats fine. I just want to ensure that I understand what is going on with all the frameworks we will be working with.

### Work

(Intro)

#### (Project Name)

* [Robot World](https://github.com/bfpepper/Robot-World)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/crud_sinatra.markdown)

Robot World was a project we had to design a Sinatra web app from scratch by tying in robot pictures to each profile. This project was a bit difficult for me as I struggled to understand setting routes and actions within Sinatra.

* [Mix Master](https://github.com/bfpepper/Mix-Master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

Mix Master had us design a Rials project for adding songs and artists to a given playlist and then tie in the Spotify API. We had to create our own routes and views which gave me a better understanding of how Rails functions.

* [Idea Box](https://github.com/bfpepper/idea-box-2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

Idea box was a quick Rails 5 mini project that was designed to give us a crash course in Rails CRUD before starting Little Shop.  I wanted to focus more on Authorization and Authentication in this project and that is where I spent my time. I knew that I would be getting more experience with routes, view, partials, etc, so I wanted to make sure I understood the security side of Rails better.

* [Blogger](https://github.com/bfpepper/blogger)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html)

Blogger was designed as a simple tutorial for how to build a blog site and to learn the basics of what Rails can accomplish. This was one of the first attempts into working with Rials and it showed me a lot of what can be done with minimal inout from the developer.

## Team

### Projects

Our team projects gave us time to not only dive deeper into Sinatra and Rails but also to to work more in teams to simulate the real world. These were both valuable projects to learn more about how Sinatra doesn't have al the "magic" of Rails but also how Sinatra is far more lightweight and customizable than Rails.

#### (Project Name)

* [Rush Hour](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush hour was designed to be a web traffic information parser. The idea was to take in raw JSON from a client and then parse it and display it in a meaningful way. This way the client could understand what info users were accessing and how their servers were functioning.

###Scores and comments
#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

###Scores and comments

###Professional Skills

Turing took more steps this module to emphasize not only professional development but also personal development. This was something that I fought at first but have started to pay more attention to. It is important to not only know how to code but also to be able to connect with a variety of people. This is what Friday Gear Ups are about to me.

####Gear up

#####Getting Better At Difficult Things

This is a difficult task for me and it was reassuring to hear from both Kathy Sierra and Ta-Nehisi Coates about their struggles as well. Dealing with difficult tasks is something that I still need to work on but this Gear Up was helpful in starting me on the right path.

#####There Is An I In Team

Dr. Brene Brown's video is what hit home the most for me during this Gear Up.  There are certain aspects of my life that I have boundaries and things are generally better when I have them. Its the hardest thing for me to set boundaries with people but it has been something that I have tried to improve over the years. It was interesting to hear her talk about how people can be more loving if there are boundaries and gave me more reason to continue down that path. Being honest and up front with people is something I had to learn while working for Tesla. It my owners could not trust what I was saying and that I had the best intentions then any hard conversation we had was going to be more difficult.

#####CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap

This was probably my most favorite Gear Up of Mod 2. The video was incredibly interesting and, well presented. I was glad that I was here to see just how pervasive the gender gap is in technology. It gave me a new perspective that I did not think I would ever see. However, the more interesting part of the Gear Up for me was the discussion. Our group was the group that wanted to discuss why this was even a discussion to have in Turing. As it turned out the group that was there were all people who wanted to hear the other side of the equation (why, in fact, this wasn't important to discuss). Since we all agreed that this was an issue the conversation turned more to how to help Turing become a truly inclusive community. We talked about some of the challenges and problems that we saw as inhibiting this and tried to find ways to improve it.

### Playing a Part

- 16 pairing sessions
- 3 student led sessions

I was very nervous about pairing with Mod 1 students. I was not sure I would be any help to them and only de-rail their projects. Once I got into pairing with them it was fun to revisit Ruby and the "simpler" times of Mod 1. Since I repeated Mod 1 I knew a lot of the struggle people felt in Mod 1 and wanted to help quell those concerns as much as possible. I know I'm not the strongest programmer yet but I know how stressful Mod 1 can be for some and wanted to help in that respect as much as possible.
