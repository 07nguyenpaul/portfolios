# Ben Pepper - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

This module for me is intended to be more about focusing on what is happening then trying to keep my feet under me. I don't want to get to a point where I am panicked about the work load or the info. So if that means taking more time with the material thats what has to happen. If I get 3's on everything thats fine. I just want to ensure that I understand what is going on with all the frameworks we will be working with.

### Work

(Intro)

#### (Project Name)

* [Robot World](https://github.com/bfpepper/Robot-World)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/outlines/crud_sinatra.markdown)

Robot World was a project we had to design a Sinatra web app from scratch by tying in robot pictures to each profile. This project was a bit difficult for me as I struggled to understand setting routes and actions within Sinatra.

* [Mix Master](https://github.com/bfpepper/Mix-Master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master)

Mix Master had us design a Rials project for adding songs and artists to a given playlist and then tie in the Spotify API. We had to create our own routes and views which gave me a better understanding of how Rails functions.

* [Idea Box](https://github.com/bfpepper/idea-box-2)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

Idea box was a quick Rails 5 mini project that was designed to give us a crash course in Rails CRUD before starting Little Shop.  I wanted to focus more on Authorization and Authentication in this project and that is where I spent my time. I knew that I would be getting more experience with routes, view, partials, etc, so I wanted to make sure I understood the security side of Rails better.

## Team

### Projects

Our team projects gave us time to not only dive deeper into Sinatra and Rails but also to to work more in teams to simulate the real world. These were both valuable projects to learn more about how Sinatra doesn't have al the "magic" of Rails but also how Sinatra is far more lightweight and customizable than Rails.

#### (Project Name)

* [Rush Hour](https://github.com/JeanJoeris/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush hour was designed to be a web traffic information parser. The idea was to take in raw JSON from a client and then parse it and display it in a meaningful way. This way the client could understand what info users were accessing and how their servers were functioning.

###Scores and comments
#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

### Playing a Part

- 16 pairing sessions
- 3 student led sessions

I was very nervous about pairing with Mod 1 students. I was not sure I would be any help to them and only de-rail their projects. Once I got into pairing with them it was fun to revisit Ruby and the "simpler" times of Mod 1. Since I repeated Mod 1 I knew a lot of the struggle people felt in Mod 1 and wanted to help quell those concerns as much as possible. I know I'm not the strongest programmer yet but I know how stressful Mod 1 can be for some and wanted to help in that respect as much as possible.
