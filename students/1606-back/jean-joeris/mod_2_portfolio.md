# Jean Joeris - M2 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I want to learn how to use CSS and HTML to create not ugly websites. I want to learn how to use Rails and Sinatra to build the backend to the websites. I want to use the knowledge of the HTTP cycyle that I learned at my internship to learn even more.

My git workflow on the Black Thursday project last mod was subpar, and I would like to fix that this mod. 

I also want to become a leader in Armstrong posse, and make good progress towards learning machine learning. At the very least I would like to gain some level of comfort with the TensorFlow library. This means I will need to learn some Python this module as well.

I also want to become the leader of LGBTuring over the course of the mod, as Nick will be graduating at the end of the mod
