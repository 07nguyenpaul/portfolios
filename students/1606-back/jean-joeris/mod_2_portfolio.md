# Jean Joeris - M2 Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I want to learn how to use CSS and HTML to create not ugly websites. I want to learn how to use Rails and Sinatra to build the backend to the websites. I want to use the knowledge of the HTTP cycyle that I learned at my internship to learn even more.

My git workflow on the Black Thursday project last mod was subpar, and I would like to fix that this mod. 

I also want to become a leader in Armstrong posse, and make good progress towards learning machine learning. At the very least I would like to gain some level of comfort with the TensorFlow library. This means I will need to learn some Python this module as well.

I also want to become the leader of LGBTuring over the course of the mod, as Nick will be graduating at the end of the mod

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

#### Little Shop of Orders

* [Original Assignment]()

Little Shop of Orders was the final mod 2 project. The goal was to take all of our knowledge gained over the module and build an e-commerce site from scratch using Ruby on Rails. We decided to build a grocery store called Good Grocers. This has been a very productive project for our group. It has solidified a lot of my understanding of rails and MVC. Additionally, I have reflected throughout on how much I have learned in 6 short weeks.

Feedback received
Jasmin Hudacsek - 
During Little Shop, Jean was invaluable asset as a group partner and was very good about helping us stay on topic and on schedule. Even though our whole cohort knows his coding skills and algorithmic knowledge are beyond impressive, he never lets it go to his head and is extremely easy to approach with any question. Outside of Little Shop, I very much enjoyed getting to know Jean even more and continue to be amazed at how awesome of a person he is in general. He’s shown awesome leadership with Armstrong and LGBTuring and I am excited to see what he can accomplish while he’s at Turing and beyond. 

Raphael Barbo -
I paired with Jean during our Little Shop Project (also know as GoodGrocers). His algorithmic thinking abilities are 
beyond admiration. I feel that Jean has a lot teacher's like skills and I have appreciated very much all the time he has put into explaining concepts and approaches that at times were not clear to me. At this moment, the only constructive feedback I can think about for Jean, is to sometimes listen more to your peers (mainly on the sense of ideas). I know having such an amazing approach to problems, and a very logical mind, make him see things from a very unique perspective. With such brilliance I believe he could turn average ideas into big awesome outcomes. It was honestly a great pleasure working with Jean and I have a lot of admiration and respect for his skills and everything he has taught me throughout the project.

Feedback given
Jasmin Hudacsek -
My experience with Jasmin was excellent. She was a very capable project manager. She consistently kept us on track, by organizing the waffle board. I was impressed with her ability to put herself in the user's shoes. Many times throughout the project she directed us away from solutions that serve us as developers towards solutions that serve the user. Despite her prior experience as a project manager, she never became overbearing. She was defend her opinions, but never try to user her knowledge as a trump card. She was also very friendly and relaxed throughout. I learned a great deal about management by watching her, and am glad we were in the same group

Raphael Barbo -
Raphael has been an awesome team member. He is always willing keep working. His work experience prior to turing shines through in his excellent work ethic and positive attitude. He even volunteered to give me a ride to and from Turing one weekend. He is a very capable coder, but doesn't let that stop him from asking for help. He has no ego about seeking help when necessary. His willingness to keep working was a huge boon to the team, as he helped make sure cards were getting done. He was always happy to take on whatever task was needed. A few times it seemed to me he was so focused to move the project forward that he didn't voice his concerns as clearly as he could have. This is not to imply he doesn't communicate well, the vast majority of the time he was voiced himself clearly. Raphael is extremely kind and was a joy to work with.

## Community
* Details on project management strategies you used in your projects (Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?
  * I tried to be extremely conscious about how I communicate with team members. In particular, I wanted to try and be empathetic and specific in feedback. From both groups I got feedback that this was really appreciated. It made them feel listened to and they were more willing to engage because of this. I did not recieve feedback that suggested to me that any particular strategy I used did not work. I try to remember this doesn't mean they were all successful, just that I haven't gotten data to tell me they were unsuccessful.
* How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process?
  * One piece of feedback I have gotten is that when I get excited I can lose some of my mindful communication. I have responded to this by trying to seek feedback from others more often, and my telling people that I might do this. It is not their responsibilty to police my behavior, but by telling them I hope to make it more comfortable if they do call me out. It has been humbling to remember how my valuing of mindful communication does not translate into 100% applicaton of this value.

* List of 10 companies with one person you could connect with at each 
  1. AlchemyAPI- Eliot Turner
  2. Auger - Josh
  3. Aetna - Todd Aron

### Giving Feedback
Other feedback is listed under the appropriate project

To Noah Berman (1608 BE) regarding his participation in the hackthe.news hackathon - 
Noah has a great drive to learn that will serve him well in programming. Despite being a mod 1 student with little coding experience prior to Turing, he came to the hackathon. This alone demonstrates that he wants to learn and isn’t afraid of jumping into something new. In the high pressure environment of a 2 hr hackathon he kept his cool. When we reached a point where he didn’t know enough rails to be helpful he pivoted into helping us using his other skills. His experience with journalism was invaluable during the hackathon, as it allowed him to quickly made design decisions to move the group forward. Noah is an excellent team member and I would love to work with him again.

### Being a Community Member

Regarding my role as Armstrong Posse lead - 
Jean has done an excellent job at organizing the Armstrong posse. He has been able to consistently and thoroughly explain the complex concepts that surround machine learning. This has made the Armstrong posse very welcoming, despite the potentially intimidating topics that naturally come out of such subjects. For future meetings, it may help notify to other members what kind of discussion will occur during the session (e.g. we might briefly touch on calculus) so members know what to expect. - Daniel Shin (1608 BE)

### Playing a Part

This module I have tried very hard to contribute to the Turing community. 

On essentially the first day of the mod I became the lead of Armstrong posse. I took on this role because I am interested in the topics Armstrong covers, Erin Greenhalgh (1603 4 BE) was graduating soon and needed to pass off this role, and because I wanted to embody the changes I wanted Armstrong to make compared to last mod. Everyone in Armstrong agreed we didn't do much last mod, so I wanted to be part of the solution to this. I haven't gone alone in this task, as Erin and Bryan Goss have been extremely helpful in organizing the posse. I also arranged to get Aaron Greenspan to come in and give lunch talks on machine learning and regression analysis. As part of Armstrong posse I also organized two Friday spike sessions.

I have also been co-leading LGBTuring with Nick Pisciotta. With Nick soon to be graduating, I am taking on the responsiblity of leading this important group. The membership numbers are not large, but I believe holding safe space for LGBTQ individuals is very important and I wanted to make sure it continued.

In addition to these two ongoing roles I participated in a hackathon with other Turing students. While this was not contributing as directly to the Turing community, by helping us get 3rd place I did my part to grow Turing's name and reputation within the tech community. The fact that multiple people said we had the most finished product at the hackathon shows we were building Turing's reputation for technical excellence.
