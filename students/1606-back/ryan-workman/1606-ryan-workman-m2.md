### Areas of Emphasis

Better understand HTML and CSS, using fundamentals of web design.  I really enjoy ruby and back-end languages, but, as I learned doing the pre-work over the intermission week, I am not very good at bending CSS to create stylish and good-looking webpages.  This module, I want to build on top of the back-end skills I learned last mod and learn how to create nice and aesthetically pleasing pages.
