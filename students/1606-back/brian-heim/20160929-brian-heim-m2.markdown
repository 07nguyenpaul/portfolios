# Brian Heim - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to improve upon my Mod 1 performance this module, not only in academics but in community involvement and professional skills as well. In academics, I wanted to focus more on making sure that I truly grasped concepts and could easily execute new skills through practice and repetition. I feel as though I achieved this goal, and truly put in the hours and never got behind of the steady Mod 2 workload. In the community I especially set out to be more involved in posses, and ended up joining Armstrong after some encouragement from Jean, who had heard that I did statistics and advanced calculus in college. I am very happy in Armstrong and have attended as many meetings as possible. With regard to Professional Skills, I wanted to learn more about how to navigate the tech job marketplace. Lia's sessions were very helpful and outlined some great strategies to aid with the job hunt and getting noticed through networking both in person and on social media. Another goal for me was to attend the Denver Startup Week job fair and gain some experience talking to companies and presenting myself well.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This section contains the only assessed work from the module, both group projects were graded. Little Shop was my favorite of the two, I enjoyed it because it allowed us to be creative and have some fun with the subject matter.

#### Feedback for Brian

##### Positives:

Extremely positive attitude all the time. Throughout the project, no matter the pace or progress, Brian was very positive. He always said things like, 'Good job' and 'We are doing great.'
Very calm and even headed during stressful situations. Even when we were stuck on problems or behind our schedule, Brian always was calm. He never lost his temper at all.
Working with Brian made the me faster. He is great finding errors and issues that I may have overlooked as I was implementing a test or code.

##### Area of growth

I challenge Brian to apply more rigor to his hypothesis formulation and strive to eliminate some of the random guessing he applied to problem solving. While random guessing is a totally legitimate strategy in some situations, Brian will be better served in forcing himself to make a hypothesis or rationalize his guesses with data and/or technical knowledge.

##### Overall

The partnership was a positive experience. It was nice that the content was the hardest part of this project.

### Gear Up

I really enjoyed Gear Up this module, especially the last Gear Up: CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap. CODE was especially significant for me because I gained new perspective that I otherwise would not have been able to. I have a fiance in tech and hear about some of these issue from her, but didn't realize all the ways that I can help fix the problem until this Gear Up.

Overall I learned alot about myself and my fellow Turingites during these sessions, and engaged in very meaningful discussions regarding these thought-provoking topics: 

#### Getting Better At Difficult Things

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to 10 interesting companies](https://gist.github.com/bheim6/ed3be7c390d1583c058745899e568434)

I learned alot about branding myself in the tech industry but really took away alot of information and tips for communicating and presenting myself professionally on social media. I already use LinkedIn but will now use Twitter as well to network and communicate with others in the industry. I also wrote down tips for keeping GitHub "clean" and also buffing it up with thing slike a personal site and a professional picture.

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1 - Details on project management strategies you used in your projects Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didnâ€™t go well?

##### The Good
* We used Waffle extensively as a project management tool during both Rush Hour and Little Shop. It was very helpful to keep track of the work that still needed to be done and organized it in a nice way that also integrates with GitHub.
* We instituted regular check-ins that kept everybody on the same page and aware of each team members' unique schedule and personal needs
* We kept communication lines open and welcome, which made discussing issues and being held accountable both respectful and actionable

##### The Not-As-Good
* I learned that I am not the best Project Manager. I enjoy using the tools and find them very helpful, but can sometimes forget to incorporate the tools into my regular workflow

2 - How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.

I received some really meaningful feedback from my Rush Hour group that I can sometimes make guesses instead of making sure that a certain query or method will work. I took this feedback to heart and let my Little Shop group know that if I start going down that rabbit hole, to call me out on it. Luckily, just being aware of this trait has helped me notice when I am doing it, and I can usually catch myself now before it even becomes an issue.

#### Networking with Lia

I liked that we had to practice networking in this lesson. It really gave us some good practice before the Denver Startup Week job fair and helped me organize my "about me" shpiel by using "Who are you", "How did you get here", and "What's next?" as guidelines to drive the conversation.
