# (Brian Heim) - (M1) Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to develop a solid understanding of the Ruby language, not only the core concepts but also implementing code using good Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals. 

I also set out to build relationships while at Turing: friendships and good working relationships with my fellow cohort-members, a solid relationship with a mentor to help guide me through my time at Turing, and to network with instructors and those in upper mods to foster connections with those who can help me with day-to-day life and projects at Turing.

### End of Module Assessment

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow


* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

#### 6. Enumerable & Collections


* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

1. Functional Expectations

  3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

2. Test-Driven Development

  2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient given projet requirements.

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

5. Enumerable & Collections

  3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
