# (Brian Heim) - (M1) Portfolio
## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to develop a solid understanding of the Ruby language, not only the core concepts but also implementing code using good Object-Oriented Programming fundamentals. 

I also set out to build relationships while at Turing: friendships and good working relationships with my fellow cohort-members, a solid relationship with a mentor to help guide me through my time at Turing, and to network with instructors and those in upper mods to foster connections with those who can help me with day-to-day life and projects at Turing.

### End of Module Assessment

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow


* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

#### 6. Enumerable & Collections


* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Work

This section highlights the individual projects that I worked on during Mod 1

#### -(Flashcards)-

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bheim6/Flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

#### (description)

  "In this project, you'll write a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

  In order to build good habits, we've broken the project up into small classes to demonstrate objects that have a single responsibility. As you work through each iteration, use TDD to drive out the desired behavior.

  The rubric for this project is included at the bottom of this file."

#### (evaluation comments)

  Notes:

  Some tests not passing
  
  Inflexible tests
  
  Some unnecessary use of ivars

#### (evaluation scores)

  Evaluation Rubric

  The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

1. Functional Expectations

  3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

2. Test-Driven Development

  2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient given projet requirements.

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

5. Enumerable & Collections

  3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


#### -(Battleship)-

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bheim6/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

#### (description)

Introduction

  "In this project you'll use Ruby to build an implementation of the classic game Battleship."


Learning Goals / Areas of Focus

  Proficiently use TDD to drive development

  Practice breaking a program into logical components

  Practice implementing a useable REPL interface

  Apply previously learned Enumerable techniques in a real context

#### (evaluation comments)

  Notes:

  Dealing with computer hardware issues

  Menu works

  Player can layout ships on the board with validations

  Did a decent job of iterating to have a thing even if the game doesn't fully play

  Overall a good 2/3 of a project

#### (evaluation scores)

Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
  
2. Enumerable & Collections

  3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques
  
3. Test-Driven Development

  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests
  
4. REPL Interface

  1: Application's REPL has enough problems as to make play difficult
  
5. Breaking Logic into Components

  2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

## Team

### Projects

This section highlights the paired projects that I worked on during Mod 1

#### -(Night Writer)-

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bheim6/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

#### (description)
  
  "The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon's army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille's development of his Braille tactile writing system.

  In this project we'll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse."
  
#### (evaluation comments)

  Notes:

  converts in both directions
  
  Does not truncate to 80 characters
  
  12 tests, not all pass
  
  Lots of replication
  
  Does not do capital letters

#### (evaluation scores)

  Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Overall Functionality

  2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully
  
2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
  
3. Test-Driven Development

  3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
  
4. Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

#### -(Black Thursday)-

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brendandillon/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)

#### (description)

  Project Overview
  
  "A business is only as smart as its data. Let's build a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business."

  Learning Goals

  Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
  
  Decompose a large application into components

  Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing

  Connect related objects together through references

  Learn an agile approach to building software

## Community

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

#### (ways you supported the larger Turing community)

  -I engaged in helping other students from 1606-b, especially with the Flashcards project. Upon receiving positive feedback for this, I decided to leave Miyamoto for Hopper posse so that I can offer help to the next generation of Mod 1 students. 
  
  -I spread the word about Turing to friends, family and former co-workers, one such co-worker has already expressed interest in joining! 
  
  -I am very active in the disc-golfers group and try to organize meet-ups at local courses and trips to new courses, also proposed the idea of "Turing Tags", an organized way to foster friendly competition between those in the group.
  
  -Started playing a part in cleaning up, washing, and putting away dishes in the Big Workspace
