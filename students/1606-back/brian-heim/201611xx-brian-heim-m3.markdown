#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

#### Feedback for Brian

##### Positives:

Extremely positive attitude all the time. Throughout the project, no matter the pace or progress, Brian was very positive. He always said things like, 'Good job' and 'We are doing great.'
Very calm and even headed during stressful situations. Even when we were stuck on problems or behind our schedule, Brian always was calm. He never lost his temper at all.
Working with Brian made the me faster. He is great finding errors and issues that I may have overlooked as I was implementing a test or code.

##### Area of growth

I challenge Brian to apply more rigor to his hypothesis formulation and strive to eliminate some of the random guessing he applied to problem solving. While random guessing is a totally legitimate strategy in some situations, Brian will be better served in forcing himself to make a hypothesis or rationalize his guesses with data and/or technical knowledge.

##### Overall

The partnership was a positive experience. It was nice that the content was the hardest part of this project.

### Gear Up

I really enjoyed Gear Up this module, especially the last Gear Up: CODE:Debugging the Gender Gap. CODE was especially significant for me because I gained new perspective that I had not been aware of before. I have a fiance in tech and hear about some of these issue from her, but didn't realize all the ways that I can personally help fix the problem until this Gear Up.

Overall I learned alot about myself and my fellow Turingites during these sessions, and engaged in very meaningful discussions regarding these thought-provoking topics:

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Finding Opportunities with Lia

* [Link to 10 interesting companies](https://gist.github.com/bheim6/ed3be7c390d1583c058745899e568434)

I learned alot about branding myself in the tech industry but really took away alot of information and tips for communicating and presenting myself professionally on social media. I already use LinkedIn but will now use Twitter as well to network and communicate with others in the industry. I also wrote down tips for keeping GitHub "clean" and also buffing it up with things like a personal site and a professional picture.

#### Collaborative Communication with Allison

1 - Details on project management strategies you used in your projects Rush Hour and/or Little Shop); What went well? What didn’t go well?

##### The Good
* We used Waffle extensively as a project management tool during both Rush Hour and Little Shop. It was very helpful to keep track of the work that still needed to be done and organized it in a nice way that also integrates with GitHub.
* We instituted regular check-ins that kept everybody on the same page and aware of each team members' unique schedule and personal needs
* We kept communication lines open and welcome, which made discussing issues and being held accountable both respectful and actionable

##### The Not-As-Good
* I learned that I am not the best Project Manager. I enjoy using the tools and find them very helpful, but can sometimes forget to incorporate the tools into my regular workflow

2 - How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process.

I received some really meaningful feedback from my Rush Hour group that I can sometimes make guesses instead of making a better hypothesis whether or not a certain action will work. I found this to be very valuable and took this feedback to heart. I let my Little Shop group know that if I start going down that rabbit hole, to call me out on it. Luckily, just being aware of this trait has helped me notice when I am doing it. Recently I have been catching myself before it even becomes an issue. 

I have always valued feedback and encouraged it, there will always be more things that I can do to improve myself.  

#### Networking with Lia

I liked that we had to practice networking in this lesson. It really gave us some good practice before the Denver Startup Week job fair and helped me organize my "about me" shpiel by using "Who are you", "How did you get here", and "What's next?" as guidelines to drive the conversation.

## E: Feedback & Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback for David Davydov

* Working with David on this project was a great experience. He is a very talented programmer with exceptional hard skills, his typing speed and TDD are especially noteworthy. He did a very good job of examining and testing edge cases to ensure that our code was as rock solid and performed as expected. David is a conscientious person when pairing and regularly seeks collaboration. When we worked on consuming our API externally, David and I consistently would step-back when stuck, and read documentation and discuss a plan of attack before moving forward and I found this to be a very successful part of the project. I appreciated David’s strong work ethic and motivation to be constantly working because it is an encouraging trait to have in a project lead, but I would challenge him to make more time for regular breaks. There were times when David would work through Pomodoros and lunch, which is a personal choice, but in my experience, in order to reduce the feeling of “burnout” and to re-focus the mind, regular breaks from coding is very beneficial. Overall, David is an amazing person to work with and I consider him one of the strongest coders in the cohort.

#### Feedback for Nate Anderson

* This was my first time working with Nate since being at Turing, and while we only paired on a small section of the code, I enjoyed working with him. Nate is easy-going and open to suggestions when writing code, which makes for a relaxed pairing environment. He regularly complimented other members of the group which was very encouraging and appreciated. Nate did a good job of checking in when the group was split into pairs (David and Nate, Rapha and myself), he would regularly check in with us and update us on their progress and sought to understand what we were working on as well. While Nate was very easy to work with, I would challenge him to assert himself into a “lead” role more often, when we paired I did most of the driving, and i noticed that this was the case with other team members as well. Navigating is an important skill to have, but assuming the Driving role is important to solidifying skills, and further advancing as a developer in general. Overall I genuinely enjoyed working with Nate and his laid-back and friendly demeanor.

#### Feedback for Raphael Barbo

* Working with Rapha on this project has been very enjoyable. He is very energetic when working and would get visibly excited when we solved problems. This energy was infectious and helped motivate me at times when I was feeling tired, especially when he and I tackled implementing jQuery datepicker to show a calendar of available dates for a listing. He is also a very determined and hard worker. Rapha regularly worked late or worked at home after the group disbanded for the night, experimenting and implementing better test coverage. He is a strong communicator and freely speaks his mind which is a great strength, but he could work on his delivery as sometimes he can come off too strongly or a little harsh. He commented on the preliminary CSS styling I had done for the site in a way that was not very constructive, but then he apologized and clarified his intent, which showed his maturity and grace, and was quite impressive to me. In fact, he and I worked on the final styling of the site and he was incredibly complimentary and encouraging. Overall I really enjoyed working with Rapha and look forward to pairing with him again.

### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback for Brian (From Nate Anderson)

* I really enjoyed finally getting a chance to work with you on a project. Our pairing time was very productive, but also light and fun which made everything much easier. Your work with the css was amazing and it was really fun watching our site come to life like that. Your dedication to getting every aspect exactly right was great to watch. I have tried to rack my brain to come up with a criticism to no avail. Your work ethic is great and it was a pleasure working with you.

#### Feedback for Brian (From David Davydov)

* Brian, you were a great team member and I strongly valued your easy-going personality and dedication throughout our project. You did a fantastic job in making our site look professional, implementing the right CSS for image cropping, centering, and all that other stuff that the rest of the team was not doing. Your commitment to the styling of the site was invaluable, and your git workflow in terms of periodically applying these stylistic changes to the progress we've made turned out to be very intuitive. Your understanding of the site's layout was solid by the end of the project, when you gave me the rundown on how to match our review form to have the same style as the other forms. In an area of growth, I would suggest that when something in the code or project is not clear, do not hesitate to pause the pairing session and use it as an opportunity to learn. There were times during our pairing that you made some suggestions that seemed random which gave me the impression that your understanding of the code flow was not fully solidified. This was never anything more than minor, but reading code is crucial and I would suggest you always stay on top of lubricating these gears of dis-clarity whenever they seem to get stuck - it will pay off dividends in the long run. You were always fun to work with and level-headed throughout the project and our team strongly benefited from having you as a partner. Thank you for your hard work and patience.

#### Feedback for Brian (From Raphael Barbo)

* Brian is very easy to work with, as far as technical skills it was really fun to work with Brian because I feel we are at the same level, and it allowed both of us to contribute towards the features we were working on.
My constructive feedback to Brian is just to keep listing to people's ideas, and different approach to problems. The beauty of being a developer is that the are 200 ways to solve the same problem.
I really enjoyed working with him, and I am looking forward to see what he accomplishes throughout his time at turing.
