### Areas of Emphasis

My main goal going in to Module 1 was to get better at understanding and writing Ruby syntax and gaining a basic understading of how to write code.  As Module 1 progressed, I learned about how important the other skills around writing the code actually were.  I had never heard of TDD or DTR, but as my learning grew, I knew I wanted to learn more about how to write good tests and how to facilitate a good environment for group work.

### End of Module Assessment

Evaluated by Mike Dao
#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow


* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration


* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### 6. Enumerable & Collections


* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### Flashcards

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

In this project, I wrote a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user can see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.

Notes:

* Looking at Flashcards
* 17 tests all pass
* Tests look pretty good but need to think about edge cases and non-happy-path tests
* Implementation is overall good. Some spots have more code than you need.


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

#### Battleship

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dski1080/battleship)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

I built a playable game of Battleship that runs in a REPL interface. The game will allow a single human player to play against a (simplistic) computer player.

Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Notes:

Missing 3-unit ship implementation
Significant refactoring needed: long methods, need to extract methods, address single responsibility needs
Otherwise thorough implementation of project
STRONG use of TDD
REPL interface solid
Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
2. Enumerable & Collections

2.5

2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests
4. REPL Interface

3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use
5. Breaking Logic into Components

2.5

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear

#### Nightwriter

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/calaway/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

In this project we implemented systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.  The core challenges involved translating a single string of text to three lines of braille represented by "."s and "0"s and then reversing the process and taking the three lines of braille and changing them back to text.

Notes:

* reads and writes
* does 160 characters
* does capitaliation and numbers
* 16 tests total
* has a readme

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality


* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style


* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
