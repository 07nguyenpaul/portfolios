# Dan Broadbent - M3 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
For Module 3 I really wanted to hone in my Rails skills.  I wanted to work on some more difficult tasks and get more hands on with the hard stuff from Module 2, like authentication and authorization.  In the pre-work, the intermediate active record queries were pretty difficult and I wanted to get more exposure to working with Active Record and SQL.  From a team perspective, in mods one and two, I was not on a team of four, I feel like having two groups of two could be quite a bit more efficient than a group of three.

## Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3
* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 3
* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3
* **D: Professional Skills**: 3
* **E: Feedback & Community Participation**: 4

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

Student: Dan

Assessor: Lauren

Notes:
-  application_controller needs protect from forgery null session for API create and delete actions to work,
-  Location could be refactored to not call BestBuyService twice (or create two separate services if necessary),
-  Faraday request could be refactored to be more modular,
-  great feature test,
-  location model test could be a little more robust.

## Evaluation Criteria

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

* 3: Developer commits almost every 15 minutes
* 2: Developer does not commit regularly
* 1: Developer has poor git workflow and does not commit regularly
* 0: Developer committed once


## B: Individual Work & Projects

I really loved the individual projects this module.  The first was API curious, where I consumed the GitHub API to make a basic profile browser.  I really allowed TDD to drive this project and was really proud that I made it so you could browse users and their followers infinitely deep.  The second was a personal project of our own choosing.  I decided to take a risk and go with a stack that was completely foreign to me, Ionic 2 with Angular 2 and a Firebase backend.  It may have been too ambitious for a two week project, but I got to learn a ton of new stuff and I'm excited to continue working on it.

This project, we focused on consuming and working with data from public APIs. I chose Github to re-construct a simplified version of the website's existing UI using their own API.  Although this project wasn't officially graded, I really enjoyed working on it and I was proud of what I accomlished in the time given.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Group Projects

Group projects were also a lot of fun this module.  First was the pair project, Rails Engine, where we created a Rails API. It was super challenging and we got exposure to more Active Record and SQL and got to learn new things like JBuilder for custom JSON endpoints.  Next was the four person project Cloney Island.  In this project we "cloned" Flickr, and made a photo-sharing rails app.  I got to work on some really fun and unique problems with each of my teammates.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Susi - Susi, I had so much fun working on Rails Engine with you.  It was a really tough project and we both tackled some really hard problems.  Your communication is fantasitic, I always knew what your personal obligations were and how things were going in the project.  Thank you for being flexible with my schedule and sticking to our DTR.  I know it wasn't ideal, but I really appreciate your understanding.  Dividing and conquering on this project worked great, and we both learned a ton.  It was great seeing you succeed on doing some of the really complex business logic.  You had mentioned that this was one of the first group projects where you really got to go out on your own and sink your teeth into a big problem without help.  You crushed it, and I hope that you take that with you going forward and continue to take risks and push your comfort zone.

### Being a Community Member

From Susi - Dan, this project was an absolute blast because I was partnered with you. Rails Engine was extremely difficult but you never once lost your cool and calm demeanor. We set our goals from the beginning and every day, sometimes twice a day, you always made sure to check and make sure we were on track. We set a deadline and we stuck to it. You let me know immediately during our DTR that you had an odd schedule that week and we were able to effectively stick to an even shorter schedule than anticipated by our teachers. It was amazing to watch you celebrate our successes! Your encouragement and confidence in the project and in me really made a huge difference. You have an extremely logical and analytical thought process that makes problem solving as a pair extremely interesting and fun - not to mention hilarious at times.

### Playing a Part

My biggest contribution this module was taking over the Bezos Posses with Madison from 1606 Frontend.  We decided to make the activities of the posse more hands on.  The most memorable activity was the $5 challenge, where pairs of students worked together to make the most profit in 2 hours with a budget of $5.  Some groups failed and some succeeded, but it was memorable for all.  We followed that up with a pitch practice, user testing workshop, and a class on Search Engine Optimization.  With the help of Megan from 1608 Backend, we were able to make a special trip to GoSpotCheck where we got to have a roundtable discussion with the CEO Matt.
