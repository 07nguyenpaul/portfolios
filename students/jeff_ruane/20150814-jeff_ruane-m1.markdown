# Jeff Ruane - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I wasn't sure what I was really getting into, I set out to learn Ruby, and while I certainly haven't mastered
it, I think I've set a good foundation. After Chisel, I wanted put an emphasis on TDD, and I think I've improved 
there. 

### End of Module Assessment

I was assessed by Josh Cheek and got the following scores:

1. Ruby Syntax & API     :3

* Nice use of RSpec
* Generally good approach

2. Ruby Style            :4

* Looks good

3. Blocks & Enumerations :3

* A bit thrown on traversing the list to get the total score
* But the overall inclinations are good

4. Testing               :3.5

* Good use of RSpec
* Good test

5. Workflow              :4

* shell aliases
* vim

6. Collaboration         :3.5

* Knew where you were
* It was enjoyable working with you

### Attendance

I had no absences or tardies this module.

### Work

This module I worked on Chisel and Linked Lists individually.

#### Linked List

[GitHub URL](https://github.com/jbrr/linked_list)  
[Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

In this project, I implemented a linked list data structure in Ruby.

I was evaluated by Jeff and got the following scores:

1. Functional Expectations                       : 3
2. Test-Driven Development                       : 3
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style                      : 3
5. Looping *or* Recursion                        : 3

Notes: Testing could using more edge cases, implementation is strong, but could use some refactoring.

#### Chisel

[GitHub ](https://github.com/jbrr/chisel)  
[Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

In this project, I made a program to convert markdown to HTML.

I was evaluated by Mike and got the following scores:

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style      : 3
2. Test-Driven Development       : 2
3. Functionality                 : 3
4. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

It wasn't strong on TDD, and I made that a goal for later projects.

## Team

### Projects

I worked on Enigma and Sales Engine as team projects this module.

#### Sales Engine

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tjkomor/sales_engine)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine.markdown)

In this project, we created a program to parse through several data types and draw relationships between them.

#### Enigma
* [Github URL](https://github.com/Unsafepond/Enigma-new)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

In this project, we recreated the famous Enigma machine, and used it to encrypt and decrypt messages.

I was evaluated by Josh with the following scores:

1. Functionality: 2
2. Fundamental Ruby and Style: 3+
3. Test-Drive Development: 3
4. Breaking Logic into Components: 3+

I recieved the following feedback from my partner: "He's very kind and productive."

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I have given feedback to both of my project partners, and to a handful of other people in my cohort and others.

### Playing a Part

I'm not generally the most outgoing person, and it takes me a while to get comfortable in a new environment. Also, 
being in the first module, and being new to programming, I didn't really have the tools to help people out, although 
I was always willing to help people if I could. I attending a handful of after school sessions, and helped clean up the 
space when it was my posse's turn to do so. In addition, I've volunteered to help get 1508 prepared during the off week.
