#Jeff Ruane - M2 Portfolio

##Individual

###Areas of Emphasis
Coming into this module, I want to do more to be an active member of the community.
I gave myself an excuse last module that I'm pretty reserved until I'm comfortable
in a new place, but I won't have that excuse to fall on this module. I'm not sure
yet what this will include, it might be running a student led session some Friday
if I can think of anything that I could teach that might be valuable. It might
also include just sticking around longer after class to offer help if I can.

I also want to keep practicing Ruby. I think I'm somewhat proficient, but there
is so much room for improvement, and I want to keep working on those skills.
Obviously, I also want to get the most I can out of the new material we'll be
covering, and I'm excited to be introduced to Rails.

I would also like to start an outside project. My idea for now is to
learn more about shell scripting. I got a book on it, an old book of my dad's,
*The Unix Programming Environment*. He also gave me a book that Dennis Ritchie
wrote, *The C Programming Language*, but learning C seems a little overwhelming
considering the other work I'll be expected to keep up on.

Finally, I want to keep old passions alive. I used to love photography, and I've
gotten out of it lately, but I'd like to start working on that again when I have
time. I think it's important to have other hobbies and passions outside of
computing, and technology in general.

###End of Module Assessment

I was assessed by Andrew:

####Scores

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking: 3
2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library: 3
3. Rails Syntax & API: 3
4. Rails Style: 3
5. Testing: 3
6. Collaboration: 3

####Notes

Worked well with me. Collaborated well. Didn't do anything out of the ordinary or spectacular with testing, but did not have any bad practices. Same for rails syntax. We did try to use some tools he had not used before and was comfortable with implementing them. Overall decent work. Has room for improvement that we spoke about but is in a good place overall.

####Traffic Spy
[GitHub](https://github.com/jbrr/traffic_spy)

[Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

In this project, we implemented Google Analytics type functionaily using
ActiveRecord, Sinatra, and Postgres. I was in a group with Mimi, Mike, and Alon.

We were evaulated by Josh M. and recieved the following scores:

1. Functional Expectations          : 3
2. Test-Driven Development          : 4
3. Encapsulation / Components       : 3
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style         : 3
5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic : 3
6. View Layer                       : 4

I recieved the following feedback from a group member (I'm not sure which one,
this is all I was sent):

"Jeff may seem quiet but when he does speak up, it's obvious that he's been attentive and contemplative about the problems at hand. He was more than willing to contribute when he felt like it would be helpful. He was also great at looking for solutions to problems without being asked."

"Nope. Jeff is pretty chill and fun to be around."

####Little Shop of Orders - Denvestments

[GitHub](https://github.com/russelleh/denvestments)

In this project, we built an ecommerce store from the ground up. The idea was
to make a microlending platform for local startups and causes. I was in a group
with Chris, MB, and Russell.

###Playing a Part

On August 20, I helped lead the orientation session for the incoming 1508
students. On the same day, I helped move furniture before and after the carpet
cleaners worked.

On August 25, Daisha recognized Adam Caron's and my efforts to reinvigorate my
posse, calling it "an inspiration".

On September 4, a pull request I submitted was accepted to the Ruby Exercises
repository making hash_test.rb more clear for beginners.

I helped George plan and host the Turing Kids Who Code class. I regularly attended
planning meetings, and although I missed the first class, I helped out at the
September 26th session.
