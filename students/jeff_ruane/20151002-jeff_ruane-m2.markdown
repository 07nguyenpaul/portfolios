###Areas of Emphasis
Coming into this module, I want to do more to be an active member of the community.
I gave myself an excuse last module that I'm pretty reserved until I'm comfortable
in a new place, but I won't have that excuse to fall on this module. I'm not sure
yet what this will include, it might be running a student led session some Friday
if I can think of anything that I could teach that might be valuable. It might
also include just sticking around longer after class to offer help if I can.

I also want to keep practicing Ruby. I think I'm somewhat proficient, but there
is so much room for improvement, and I want to keep working on those skills.
Obviously, I also want to get the most I can out of the new material we'll be
covering, and I'm excited to be introduced to Rails.

I would also like to start an outside project. My idea for now is to
learn more about shell scripting. I got a book on it, an old book of my dad's,
*The Unix Programming Environment*. He also gave me a book that Dennis Ritchie
wrote, *The C Programming Language*, but learning C seems a little overwhelming
considering the other work I'll be expected to keep up on.

Finally, I want to keep old passions alive. I used to love photography, and I've
gotten out of it lately, but I'd like to start working on that again when I have
time. I think it's important to have other hobbies and passions outside of
computing, and technology in general.

###Playing a Part

On August 20, I helped lead the orientation session for the incoming 1508
students. On the same day, I helped move furniture before and after the carpet
cleaners worked.

On August 25, Daisha recognized Adam Caron's and my efforts to reinvigorate my
posse, calling it "an inspiration".

On September 4, a pull request I submitted was accepted to the Ruby Exercises
repository making hash_test.rb more clear for beginners.
