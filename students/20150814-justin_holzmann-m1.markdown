# Justin Holzmann - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
* Learn Vim to improve and optimize work flow.
* Fix my personal habit structures (the first time I did module 1 I lost many of
the positive habits that I had spent the previous year building).
* Read 4 books on Ruby to match my year long goal of 12 Ruby books.
* Do all extensions on projects assigned.
* Practice pairing.
* Adobt a morning practice routine before school.

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Attendance

Perfect attendance except for Wednesday, July 29th when I wasn't feeling well.

### Work

* I've heard Jeff oftentimes mention that "time is the easy lever". Since day 1
I've tried to push that lever as much as possible. In terms of raw hours I think
I at least rival the hardest workers in the program.
* 9 levels of Vim Adventures game
* Went through Josh Cheeks Ruby katas at least once per kata
* Started reading Ruby documentation as per Josh M's recommendation in final
assessment from 1505
* Practiced Hashes in all projects (instead of arrays)
* Read The Little Book of Talent
* Listened to The Talent Code

  This project was an automatic sudoku solver (load in a puzzle and it solves it).
  I was assessed by Jeff and these were his comments and scores:


  "Some tests and some decent implementation but doesn't quite work."

  "Could use refactoring, especially of conditionals-in-conditionals."

  A software spin on the original encrypting and decrypting messaging platform
  that the German army used in WWII. Very fun project. I focused on using hashes
  as per my module goals and on using as many classes as possible.

  I was assessed by Mike with the following comments and scores:

  "Encrypts and decrypts"
  "Crack does not work"
  "Needs better unit testing"
  "Believe the crack sent program into an infinite loop"

  * Functionality: 2
