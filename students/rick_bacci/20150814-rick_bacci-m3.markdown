# Rick Bacci - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I wanted to continue to focus on maintaining  a
professional project workflow. This applies to both individual and group
projects. I also wanted to continue to improve on understanding the rest of
my teams thought process, and making sure that I am able to communicate my
thoughts as well.
