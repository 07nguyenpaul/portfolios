## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

For Module 2, my goal was to continue to work hard learning Sinatra and Rails
while maintaining my newly acquired Ruby skills and starting to re-learn
JavaScript. I also wanted to improve my soft skills including pairing, group
work, workflow, and mentoring. Last but not least, I wanted to be an active
part of both the Turing community and the community outside of Turing.

I paired with mentors on Ruby and JavaScript exercises. I paired and mob coded
with different people and teams. I actively participated in all Turing
activities, and made contributions wherever I saw the opportunity.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time.

### Work

I completed the following team projects this module:

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/imwithsam/traffic-spy)
* [Original
  Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/traffic-spy-skeleton)

This group project served as our first major introduction to building a web app.
We used Sinatra with ActiveRecord. We largely mob coded on this project.

"Really solid project. Naturally using presenter pattern."

### Playing a Part

I have helped mentor/pair with students in Module 1, and do my best to be a good
example by actively participating in morning warmpups and Friday activities. I
also do little things like buy coffee beans, make coffee, handle dishes, etc. on
an ongoing basis. I organized a couple of outings (hiking, UMS) for Turing
students. I gave a Lightning Talk on Turing Pro Tips, in part trying to inform
and encourage students in fostering a healthier and better learning environment.

Outside of Turing, I attended many different MeetUps including Denver.rb,
Boulder Ruby, DenverScript, and ReactJS.
