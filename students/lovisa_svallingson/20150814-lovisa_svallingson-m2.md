# Lovisa Svallingson - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
In module 1 I was quite introverted and preferred to work by myself and didn't
interact much with the other students in my cohort. I was, and still am, extremely
focused on the work that we are doing and unfortunately some of the social aspects
of being a student at Turing are suffering due to this.

That's why this module I have tried to reach out more (I don't know i anyone
noticed) and am trying to get projects started such as the podcast and hopefully
an open source project.

I also have a tendency to take the group leader role in group projects and I wanted
to practice being on a team instead of leading a team.
