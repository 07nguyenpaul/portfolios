# Mike Schutte - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals were to: (1) master the foundations of Ruby and object-oriented programming, so that I
could (2) look at a problem and have conceptual intuition about the algorithm required
without needing to go straight to my computer.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/date-night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Date Night is an application of constructing and traversing a binary search tree. 
Given attributes of the tree, such as depth or node value, 
the program traverses the tree via recursion to implement a given method, such as determining the number of "child" nodes that belong to a "parent" node.

Evaluation Notes

* 34 tests, all pass
* Testing looks good at multiple levels
* Implementation is strong with some little bit for refactoring

Score

* Test-Driven Development

  * 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

* Functional Expectations

  *  4: did two extensions

* Breaking Logic into Components

  * 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

* Fundamental Ruby & Style

  * 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

Voting is an interesting topic. As someone brought up in our discussion, it's hard to imagine anyone
who is expressedly "anti-voting", so on the other side of fervent "Vote or Die"-type mantras are are not 
fists or counter-arguments, just lazy shoulder shrugs. Moving forward, the dialectic of rights and responsibilities
is top of mind. It seems like current US culture teaches us to cling to the former, and barely touch the latter, so I want 
to make a better effort to keep in mind the responsibilities I have that enable my rights.    

#### (session)

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmikeschu)
* [Resume]()

It's hard to accept that relatively static representations of a person can be so influential in impression management, but that's the case. 
I used to roll my eyes at this kind of stuff, but now I better understand the idea of "perception is reality," and I have newfound intrinsic
motivation to develop a quality personal brand online (and off).
