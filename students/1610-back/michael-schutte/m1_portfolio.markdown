# Mike Schutte - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals were to: (1) master the foundations of Ruby and object-oriented programming, so that I
could (2) look at a problem and have conceptual intuition about the algorithm required
without needing to go straight to my computer. At a non-technical level, I sought to both ask for
and provide support frequently in order to create a healthy learning environment.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Below are the projects I worked on independently to develop mastery of OOP and the Ruby lanuage. 
They are listed in chronological order.

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/date-night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Date Night is an application that constructs and traverses a binary search tree. 
Given attributes of the tree, such as depth or node value, 
the program traverses the tree via recursion to implement a given method, such as determining the number of "child" nodes that belong to a "parent" node.

Assessed By: Jeff Casimir

Evaluation Notes

* 34 tests, all pass
* Testing looks good at multiple levels
* Implementation is strong with some little bit for refactoring

Score

* Test-Driven Development

  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

* Functional Expectations

  4: did two extensions

* Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

* Fundamental Ruby & Style 

  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

#### HTTP, Yeah You Know Me!

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/http_yykm)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

For this project, I took a head first dive into the world of HTTP request-response cycles. This is 
my first go at integrating algorithms and programs with a pseudo web application (baby steps!).
Using the localhost URL, I developed a simple server with simple features, including
word verification, greeting, and a number guessing game.

Assessed By: Ilana

Evaluation Notes

* 53 tests - all passing 
* set up modules for a lot of functionality
* well-broken out.

Score

* Overall Functionality

  3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

* Fundamental Ruby & Style

  4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

* Test-Driven Development

  3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

* Breaking Logic into Components

  4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

## C: Group Work & Projects

The following projects involved at least one other partner, and are listed in chronological order.

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tmikeschu/complete-me)
* [DTR Memo](https://github.com/tmikeschu/complete-me/blob/master/dtr_complete_me_dk_ms.pdf)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)
Complete Me extends the idea of binary search tree nodes to the concept of Tries, in which a node has N number of branches instead of just two.
The program stores words via connected node paths, where nodes store hash links with the next letter as the key and the next node as the value.
This type of data structure is most useful for predictive text features in an application. 
More specifically, as a user types, all of the pathways from the most recent character in a 
string are populated (displaying only the first few or most popular) and offered as suggestions
so as to save the user from extra typing.

Assessed By:  Sally MacNicholas

Evaluation Notes
* Overall great job
* Room for improvement to break out if/else statements into separate methods
* Discussed methods that are doing one thing OR another. Could break those out
 into its own for SRP
* Good job testing for edge cases
* Did the address extension

Scores

* Test-Driven Development

  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases

* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

  3.5: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).


* Fundamental Ruby & Style

  3.5:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

* Enumerable & Collections

  4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods and collections

* Functional Expectations

  4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

Voting is an interesting topic. As someone brought up in our discussion, it's hard to imagine anyone
who is expressedly "anti-voting", so on the other side of fervent "Vote or Die"-type mantras are are not 
fists or counter-arguments, just lazy shoulder shrugs. Moving forward, the dialectic of rights and responsibilities
is top of mind. It seems like current US culture teaches us to cling to the former, and barely touch the latter, so I want 
to make a better effort to keep in mind the responsibilities I have that enable my rights.    

#### (session)

* [GitHub URL]()

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tmikeschu)
* [Resume]()

It's hard to accept that relatively static representations of a person can be so influential in impression management, but that's the case. 
I used to roll my eyes at this kind of stuff, but now I better understand the idea of "perception is reality," and I have newfound intrinsic
motivation to develop a quality personal brand online (and off).


#### Learning to Pair

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md)
* DTR Memo: See Complete Me

Opening up a deep conversation about personal habits and life situations with a relative stranger 
isn't the most natural thing in the world, but that awkwardness is worth it. Most, if not all, collaborations
will have some turbulence, so might as well frontload it to clear space for quality work time. 
I look forward to learning more about myself through these in order to better DTR.

#### Feedback

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/feedback_1.md)
* See feedback from and for me in the Complete Me project section.

Historically, I have the hardest time receiving feedback from the people to whom I feel closest.
I enjoyed learning about the relationship trigger, and how to put it in perspective to ultimately 
move past it. Moving forward, I will work on moving from a "you or me" story to a "you and me" one,
where the snag is located in the relationship system instead of at the individual level.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To David Knott (for Complete Me): 
Overall, you were a great partner for Complete Me.  Being our first partner project, 
we had some awkward learn as we go moments in terms of setting expectations and checking 
in with each other, but we got through it with smiles and positive attitudes. For future 
group projects, I recommend you work on communication. Itâ€™s my impression that your thoughts develop very quickly, which makes verbalization difficult. For me as the receiver, your ideas sounded choppy and were hard for me to follow. 

On the positive side, I appreciate you fully put yourself out there, expressing your strengths in developing functionality and weaknesses in organization and simplicity. At points where I had developed parts of the project that were ahead of your progress, you always meaningfully contributed to the high-level discussion and low-level implementation of the feature at hand. Lastly, and most simply, I very much appreciate your willingness to show up at 7am each morning this week for pair programming. I think our last two days were especially collaborative and productive because of our commitment to do extra and early work in the beginning.
