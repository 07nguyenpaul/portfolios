### Gear Up
#### Vote Your Conscience 10/7/2016

I really enjoyed thinking about rights and their corresponding responsibilities. Coming into the session I was concerned about the session devolving into partisan politics, and I thought maybe it would be a good idea to try to focus the conversation on other ballot items. There was very little unstructured discussion time, so it wasn't a problem. Since the session I've been thinking about voting being mandatory. I thought that was some of the juiciest discussion from the session, with valid points challenging what I thought was obviously a good idea (mandatory voting). We talked about at making election day a holiday, and someone brought up the fact that the people who don't vote are those who feel disenfranchised, and those people are also likely to have service industry jobs that wouldn't give them the day off anyway. Also I am returning to Colorado and very interested in the mail-in-ballot system.

This session really clarified a lot of questions about my LinkedIn and resume that I didn't know I had, like what order to put the sections in and what to include. I was a little dissapointed that my "hobbies and interests" section doesn't really belong on my resume unless it's directly applicable to the job I'm seeking. I am also glad that there were deliverables about this so early. I am excited for the job search, but I want to make sure I'm doing it right, so this is a very important topic for me.
