## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Date Night

* (https://github.com/drod1000/Date-Night)
* (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

(description)

Notes:

* 15 tests all pass
* Tests are strong with some gaps for better progression / edge cases / simple cases
* Implementation is good, doesn't quite feel like native Ruby
* Overall a strong project

Scores:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 2. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.
