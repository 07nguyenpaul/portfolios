## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Date Night

* (https://github.com/drod1000/Date-Night)
* (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

(description)

Notes:

* 15 tests all pass
* Tests are strong with some gaps for better progression / edge cases / simple cases
* Implementation is good, doesn't quite feel like native Ruby
* Overall a strong project

Scores:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 2. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Nightwriter

* (https://github.com/Sh1pley/nightwriter)
* (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

(description)

Notes:

Able to convert to braille to english and vice versa
File IO has too much logic in it, would have liked to seen the logic broken out into translator or wherever it would have made the most sense.
A few classes in translator class have a lot of room to break out into smaller methods
Discussed using constants in the future, but liked that it was at least broken out into its own class

Scores:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 4. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension
