# Daniel Rodriguez - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

When I first started at Turing my goal was to familiarize myself with Ruby and get used to thinking through problems logically to give myself a good foundation as a new developer. As the module progressed, I realized that that there are a lot of things that go into writing good and readable code that I wasn't aware of initially. I struggled with using a test driven development approach at first so I made it a point to improve on it. Although I know I still have a way to go I'm proud of the strides I've made and hope to turn this into a strength of mine as I move through the program.

## A: End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Beth Sebian

Challenge: What Can I Make

Notes:
* Nice testing
* Clear comfort with using Ruby

Scores:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to write Ruby with a minimum of reference or debugging

### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### 5. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* N/A

## B: Individual Work & Projects

The two individual projects that I worked on during Module 1 (Date Night and HTTP) are listed below:

#### Date Night

* https://github.com/drod1000/Date-Night
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown

* Date Night stores movies according to their score by using a binary search tree

Notes:

* 15 tests all pass
* Tests are strong with some gaps for better progression / edge cases / simple cases
* Implementation is good, doesn't quite feel like native Ruby
* Overall a strong project

Scores:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 2. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

#### HTTP

* https://github.com/drod1000/http
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown

* HTTP builds a functioning web server

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality
* 2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

## C: Group Work & Projects

The two pair projects that I worked on during Module 1 (Nightwriter and Black Thursday) are listed below:

#### Nightwriter

* https://github.com/Sh1pley/nightwriter
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown

* Nightwriter converts text files from english to braille and back

Notes:

* Able to convert to braille to english and vice versa
* File IO has too much logic in it, would have liked to seen the logic broken out into translator or wherever it would have made the most sense
* A few classes in translator class have a lot of room to break out into smaller methods
* Discussed using constants in the future, but liked that it was at least broken out into its own class

Scores:

### 1. Test-Driven Development

* 3.5: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

### 4. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

To Jesse Shipley:

Jesse was my partner for our first paired project, Nightwriter. I was a little nervous about working on a project with another person for the first time but I’m happy to say that working with Jesse was a great experience. In our DTR session we talked about our strengths and weaknesses and how we planned to approach the project. We kept an open line of communication as we were working through it which was vital to us turning in a product that we were proud of. Throughout the project Jesse demonstrated that he is a creative problem solver, a hard worker who never gives up, and someone who is always looking for ways to improve. I’m sure that he will keep doing great at Turing and I look forward to working with him again in the future.

### Being a Community Member

From Jesse Shipley:

Daniel was my first partner in paired coding. During the DTR we both openly discussed what we enjoyed about code, and the ways we thought we understood each step following with the things we thought we struggled with. Daniel's technical ability with Ruby was integral to forming the framework of our project. He was able to flawlessy take my mechanical/logical ideas and teach me how to implement them into code. The pairing with Daniel was the bar to reach for every pairing I have had since, both with fellow 1610 students and other mod students as well. I could not have hand selected a better partner to learn along side during our early weeks at school. His input and constructive criticism were greatly appreciated, and I am certain pairing with him helped me grasp some important fundamentals in Ruby and coding in general.

From Marisa Burton:

Daniel was a great partner. He is a strong programmer and led the way through stressful and tough coding moments. He has strong organizational and logical skills. He is a hard worker who doesn't stop coding until he thinks it's the best, refactored code he can possibly write at the given moment. He always explained his thought processes really well, and I learned a lot from him by working with him on Black Thursday and would be happy to work with him again.
