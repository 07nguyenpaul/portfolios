# Amara Lovato - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My areas of emphasis were mainly getting familiar with the concepts (classes, methods, instances, testing) and being able to use them confident in specific projects. In order to do that, I focused on reviewing the lessons plans before and after the class, working on drills on a regular basis and reading documentation and books about Ruby. From day 1 I had a lot of help and support, especially from people repeating, so I wanted to help as well other people of my cohort and try to progress as a team not letting anybody behind. One thing that I need to still work on is learning how to find suitable sources to find solutions and examples to solve challenges that I face in projects. If I have not being able to fix something after an hour googling it and trying several things, I tend to ask my peers if they know how.

Keeping my final goal in mind (create great tools to make the world better) really helped to be motivated to work hard. I wish I would have had more tech knowledge because I feel it makes a huge difference when facing module 1. Coming from a non tech industry, for me it has been an enormous hurdle to overcome in terms of related knowledge and learning pace.

# Mastermind

* GitHub URL: https://github.com/pixapi/mastermind.git
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown

Mastermind consists in creating a game where the user tries to guess a randomly created four digit password which can contain the letters G (green), B (blue), Y (yellow) and R (red). After every try the user is informed if the guess was correct and equals the password or otherwise how many letters in the right position or different position are in the user guess compared to the password. The user can keep playing or quit the game as well as choose cheat to see the answer. When the user guesses the password, how many tries and how long it took is provided. The project includes a code generator, a REPL, a counter to track times and time and several complex methodsto evaluate the input versus the password

# Evaluation Comments:

Got a little turned around when trying to pull together multiple classes
Separate the files better into lib and test and delete inactive files
TDD could be stronger and test things that need to be tested, not just simple things

# Evaluation Scores:

1. Test-Driven Development
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality
1: Application's REPL has several issues or application fails to run

3. Breaking Logic into Components
2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

5. Enumerable & Collections
2: Application only uses the most basic Enumerable techniques.

# 99 bottles
* GitHub URL: https://github.com/pixapi/bottles
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/99_bottles.markdown

99 bottles consists in create a program that displays the famous song "99 bottle of beer on the wall" discounting a bottle from the number of bottles every time that the song is sung until there aren't any bottles on the wall. It basically uses loops in order to make the countdown and display the changes in the lyrics that occur for the last times.

# Evaluation Comments:
There were many opportunities for refactoring.

# Evaluation Scores:
This project was part of a special continuous evaluation program.

# Wizarding Bank
* GitHub URL: https://github.com/pixapi/wizarding.git
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/wizarding_bank.markdown

This project consists in building a program that allows create bank accounts in different banks for several people that have initally certain cash. The program also performs the normal bank operations: withdrawal, transfer money between account and keep track of the balances in each account. The primary learning goal is the use of classes, methods and passing info around through arguments and variables.

# Evaluation Comments:
Trouble with passing arguments and calling methods from other classes. Good effort in TDD.

#Evaluation Scores:
This project was part of a special continuous evaluation program.

# Enigma
* GitHub URL: https://github.com/pixapi/enigma
* Original Assignment: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown

This project consists of building a program that simulates the encryptation method used during the Cold War. The system rotates characters and numbers in a way that having the key and knowing the rotations allows to decrypt the message. However, there is a way to do it without the key that's called to crack the message. The goal of this project was to do the first part of the solving process that is the whiteboarding/pseudocoding,  focusing on identifying classes and their attributes.

# Evaluation Comments:
Good visual map to identify classes and attributes. Trouble to think of next steps in Ruby. Good effort in TDD.

# Evaluation Scores:
This project was part of a special continuous evaluation program.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This section will display the pair projects that we did during module 1. The main learning goals are the technical knowledge and use of Ruby but also and as important as is how to work with somebody in a project. In order to perform well working in pairs, there is an initial discussion called DTR (Define the Relationship) where pairs talk about how are their styles to work, schedules and other factors that condition their good performance; at the end of the discussion they achieve a compromise and determine some rules for a good workflow.

#### Night Writer

#Evaluation Comments:

Successfully converts either way
11 tests, one failing test
FILE IO tests arent meaningful
Remember that each method should have its own tests.
Remember to add edge cases for tests
Numerous methods are missing corresponding tests
I like the fact that the dictionaries are broken, out but use constants and test it.
Watch CRs and spacing, use of them makes code more readable.

#Evaluation Scores:

1. Test-Driven Development
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

2. Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

3. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

4. Overall Functionality
2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

#Feedback from Jason:
Amara was a joy to work with. With the gap in understanding she was continually stoping to ask questions to make sure that she was understanding what it was our project was doing and what we were trying to accomplish. It was great because on more than one occasion while talking things out we would realize that it wouldn’t the way that was being anticipated so we were able to save some time. Her thirst for understanding and knowledge was amazing and was a great motivator to do the best we could throughout the project. Her flexibility to be able to come in on the weekend was also extremely helpful and appreciated. The biggest thing that I would say she needs to work on is to ask even more questions that there were times that we would get locked in doing things and then there would be a bunch of things that she didn’t fully grasp (part of that was on me getting in a grove and would just start chugging along)

#Feedback to Jason:
Jason, it was great working with you. I really liked that you were always ready to stop for as much as needed to answer my questions and you took into consideration all my suggestions. Although there was a big gap of knowledge between us you were very supportive and doing your best to make me feel as a contributor. You were also very adaptable and understanding trying to accommodate our schedules. Some things that could improve for future pairs would be to dedicate more time to whiteboard in order to discuss strategy, see the steps and go through little pieces together. The pace was too fast for me so it was hard for me to catch up but at the same time I understand that there was a rush to progress to finish the project on time. Reviewing the code together and making sure that we were in the same page would also have been useful. But globally speaking, it was a very positive experience and I’m happy that I was paired with you because you are a great classmate and a very talented teacher.

#Feedback from Amy:

#Feedback to Amy: 

Amy is one of the best people that I have worked with. She is not only smart and resourceful but also humble and collaborative so it was a real pleasure to work with her. In spite of the complexity and many challenges of the project, she always kept motivated and dedicated endless hours to fix any single problem until the tests were passing. She is hard-working, tenacious and resilient in such a high level that I admire her for that. I appreciate that she slowed down and explained me concepts to make sure that we were in the same page and working together. She was always ready for questions and discuss strategies. Even in the most stressful moments, she kept calm, focus and kept working towards our goals. She will be a great programmer and an awesome team member for any company that she works for.

******** REVIEW WHAT I WROTE TAKING THE FOLLOWING SPECS INTO ACCOUNT (3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)*****************

The session "Vote Your Conscience" made me realized that to vote is not only a right as I thought but being a citizen also means a responsibility to participate in the democratic process and stay inform of issues in the community. I mean, I knew that it's the right thing to do but I never saw it as a inherited duty for all when becoming citizens so I found it a very powerful argument. In addition to that, I really liked the discussion in our group about what were the different perspectives that we had in elections and how each of us were looking at different things when evaluating candidates. I feel that sometimes we hang out with similar people to us and it's always eye opening to hear about other believes, approaches and ways to see politics or topics such as foreign policy, tax policy, gun control or other controversial issues.

# Giving Feedback

To Edilene Cruz:
Edilene, your incredible resilience and hard work are an inspiration to me. Your always positive and encouraging attitude made many of us keep moving forward in this challenging experience. You are a very caring person with a big heart, always asking us how we were doing and sharing with us resources and even pairing sessions in your committed will to help us. I am positive that you will be successful in your goal to become a great developer because you are not only smart and resourceful but also a one-of-a-kind team member.

To Annie Wolff:
Annie, I love that you are always eager to help us and you have a unique way to do it. You are always active listening (never assuming things), you support us to find the solutions for ourselves, you never use advance words that can make us feel behind and you have always nice words to encourage us. You are an advance coder but always humble so that makes you even better from my perspective. Your cheerfulness and energy in the group makes a big positive difference, you make us laugh with your authenticity and fresh personality. You are a great human asset for the Turing community, I see you in the soon future becoming a great programmer and an awesome mentor. I feel very lucky to have met you!

To Caroline Powell:

Caroline, your confidence and will to make a positive change in the world are impressive. I love that you never accept things how they are but find ways to make them awesome. You are creative but in a practical way, you are not a dreamer, you are a doer and I'm sure that you will succeed in your entrepreneurial and transformative ideas. Having you in Turing will make the experience much more powerful in a learning and human perspective. Being so ambitious, hard-working and smart, I can only envision for you a brilliant career.

### Being a Community Member

From Edilene Cruz:
Amara, your positivity is absolutely contagious and your desire to strenghthen the student community is amazing! During the hardships that learning something new brings, you were always there to encourage and remind me the ultimate goal of this amazing, crazy and long road we are on. I hope that I will have the chance to work with you in a project and continue to share a little bit of our cultures through food like we did this module. Keep spreading positivity!

From Marlo Major:
I've been working with Amara for several weeks now and I have to say I am super proud of how far she's come. Initially, there was the typical Turing module one worry that everyone goes through, but over time, it's been great to see her take this stress and use it as a strength. It's been great watching her go from "I don't know what I'm doing at all" to a well written test suite, 100% test driven project, and a clearly written, easily maintainable project. One critique I have for Amara is that she tends to have too much caution when it comes to writing code or giving an answer to a problem.  It would be nice if she eventually learned how to throw caution to the wind and dig in, failing possibly but also learning what works and what doesn't faster. It's been an immense pleasure mentoring Amara. It's actually one of the things I'm most proud to have ever contributed to the Turing community. It had excited me to take on more students in the future, which I certainly plan on doing!

From Annie Wolff:
Amara, your dedication to learning the material is almost unmatched in our cohort. Even when you are frustrated, you persevere in your effort to understand and master ruby. Moreover, you are able to look past current struggles and see many learning opportunities that you go after with gusto. You do not accept the status quo and your efforts to grow and change consistently improve the experience of your peers. You're a natural leader and I feel fortunate that I get to work with you everyday.

From Caroline Powell:
Amara is so inspiring to be around. She is great at bringing people together and making our time at Turing enjoyable for everyone. She is full of new ideas and will be a great addition to any company culture that she's thrown into because she has the ability to excite and motivate others.

# Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

I actively participated in the cohort retro and surveys providing new ideas to Turing experience even more awesome. In order to strengthen the team sense,
I encourage our cohort to get together every Thursday after wrap up to celebrate together that we made it one more week. Some members of the cohort and I met
several times to create a list of tech topics that we knew and others that we wanted to learn about. Then we surveyed the rest of our cohort to find out which of
those tech topics people were interested in and if others. We presented it to Alison and she suggested that creating a new posse to go through these topics and
build markdowns for the future would be suitable.
I've been attending to productivity lunch and impostor syndrome lunch and both groups have been extremely helpful.
