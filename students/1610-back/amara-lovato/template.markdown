# Amara Lovato - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My areas of emphasis were mainly getting familiar with the concepts (classes, methods, instances, testing) and being able to use them confident in specific projects. In order to do that, I focused on reviewing the lessons plans before and after the class, working on drills on a regular basis and reading documentation and books about Ruby. From day 1 I had a lot of help and support, especially from people repeating, so I wanted to help as well other people of my cohort and try to progress as a team not letting anybody behind. One thing that I need to still work on is learning how to find suitable sources to find solutions and examples to solve challenges that I face in projects. If I have not being able to fix something after an hour googling it and trying several things, I tend to ask my peers if they know how.

Keeping my final goal in mind (create great tools to make the world better) really helped to be motivated to work hard. I wish I would have had more tech knowledge because I feel it makes a huge difference when facing module 1. Coming from a non tech industry, for me it has been an enormous hurdle to overcome in terms of related knowledge and learning pace.

# Evaluation Comments:

Got a little turned around when trying to pull together multiple classes
Separate the files better into lib and test and delete inactive files
TDD could be stronger and test things that need to be tested, not just simple things

#Evaluation Scores:

1. Test-Driven Development
1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality
1: Application's REPL has several issues or application fails to run

3. Breaking Logic into Components
2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

5. Enumerable & Collections
2: Application only uses the most basic Enumerable techniques.

#Evaluation Comments:

Successfully converts either way
11 tests, one failing test
FILE IO tests arent meaningful
Remember that each method should have its own tests.
Remember to add edge cases for tests
Numerous methods are missing corresponding tests
I like the fact that the dictionaries are broken, out but use constants and test it.
Watch CRs and spacing, use of them makes code more readable.

#Evaluation Scores:

1. Test-Driven Development
2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

2. Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

3. Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

4. Overall Functionality
2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

#Feedback from Jason:
He told me that although I could feel that my participation in the project was limited, I was contributing a lot by asking him questions and remind him to slow down.
That forced him to say out loud what we were trying to do and many times by doing that he realized that there was a better strategy.
Furthermore, by explaining the concepts to me he was understanding better them. He also told me that I was good at finding bugs, especially with misspellings.

#Feedback to Jason:
I told Jason that it was a big challenge to overcome our knowledge gap and that the fact that he decided to work on his own on the project made me feel more alienated of the project
and harder for me to catch up as he renamed variables or modified methods so it was hard to follow or contribute. Another thing that I shared with him was that I regretted not having
dedicated more time for white boarding the problem and go through the little pieces together. That would have helped me to understand better what was in his mind and the small steps that were necessary and challenges.

******** REVIEW WHAT I WROTE TAKING THE FOLLOWING SPECS INTO ACCOUNT (3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)*****************

The session "Vote Your Conscience" made me realized that to vote is not only a right as I thought but being a citizen also means a responsibility to participate in the democratic process and stay inform of issues in the community. I mean, I knew that it's the right thing to do but I never saw it as a inherited duty for all when becoming citizens so I found it a very powerful argument. In addition to that, I really liked the discussion in our group about what were the different perspectives that we had in elections and how each of us were looking at different things when evaluating candidates. I feel that sometimes we hang out with similar people to us and it's always eye opening to hear about other believes, approaches and ways to see politics or topics such as foreign policy, tax policy, gun control or other controversial issues.

# Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)

I actively participated in the cohort retro and surveys providing new ideas to Turing experience even more awesome. In order to strengthen the team sense,
I encourage our cohort to get together every Thursday after wrap up to celebrate together that we made it one more week. Some members of the cohort and I met
several times to create a list of tech topics that we knew and others that we wanted to learn about. Then we surveyed the rest of our cohort to find out which of
those tech topics people were interested in and if others. We presented it to Alison and she suggested that creating a new posse to go through these topics and
build markdowns for the future would be suitable.
I've been attending to productivity lunch and impostor syndrome lunch and both groups have been extremely helpful.
