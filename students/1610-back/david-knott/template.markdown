# David Knott - (M1) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
I set out to learn as much as I could here at Turing as well as to learn how to be a beter community member.  I learned about ruby, programming, and workflow in general these past 6 weeks and I am happy with the progress I've made while realising that I still have a long wayu to go.  After the first few

## B: Individual Work & Projects

 During the six weeks so far I have been taught the value of being methodical and have been reminded of that value on a near daily basis.  This is where I have learned the most, granted at first it TDD was painful and whiteboarding seemed pointless but after countless hours stuck I see that in programming like the majority of other things in conceptualizing and remembering to make sure I'm on the right path will always pay off in the long run.

(evaluation comments)

Test-Driven Development - Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.
Functional Expectations -  Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions.
Breaking Logic into Components - Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
Fundamental Ruby & Style - Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

## D: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### (Vote Your Conscience)
  I gained a lot by listening to other people perspectives surround the current political situation in the United States and about the place of voting within Western Society in genereal.  The main thing that I will try to do deferently after my group discussion is to stay calm and listen, to often political discussions turn into a series of personal attacks due to the participants assosciating there politcal views as part of their identity.

#### (Introversion and Extroversion on Teams)
 My group was more at ease then usual, most likely because this Gear Up was conducted within everyones own module which created a safer space for the sharing of ideas.  As a result the conversation my group had was extremely authentic and each member had enough courage to draw on personal experiences from their own lives to add to the discussion.   The main take away from this discussion is that although our culture tends to look down on introverts there are more of them then I had previously though and they con be just as effective and efficient in the modern world as an extrovert.

#### (Resilience)
 I didn’t enjoy discussing resilience because the first half of the discussion was spent trying to convince us that it is important which I feel most people particularly those at Turing already know.  The more interesting question with regards to resilience is how it can be fostered on the individual level,  although we touched on this I didn’t feel comfortable enough with my group to share my personal struggles with regards to resilience.  The discussion did prompt a significant amount of introspective thought afterwards as to how I can force myself to build healthier habits which I believe would create the best foundation for me to acquire a higher level of resilience.
