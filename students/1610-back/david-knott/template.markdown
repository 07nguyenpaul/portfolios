(evaluation comments)

Test-Driven Development - Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.
Functional Expectations -  Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions.
Breaking Logic into Components - Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
Fundamental Ruby & Style - Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

(evaluation scores)

Functional Expectations - 4 
Test-Driven Development - 3
Breaking Logic into Components - 2
Fundamental Ruby & Style - 2

## D: Professional Skills
 ?????

### Gear Up
#### (Vote Your Conscience)
  I gained a lot by listening to other people perspectives surround the current political situation in the United States and about the place of voting within Western Society in genereal.  The main thing that I will try to do deferently after my group discussion is to stay calm and listen, to often political discussions turn into a series of personal attacks due to the participants assosciating there politcal views as part of their identity.
