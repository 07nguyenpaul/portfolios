# Nicholas Erhardt - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

This module I was looking forward to focusing on fundamentals.  By that I mean I was comfortable with the concept that Ruby can be used to to express a problem/solution, but I felt very much in the dark about *how* to organize code (classes, methods), what approach to take (where to start, how to think about breaking down the problem first) and [something else].  I also wanted to write a *lot* of code.  I felt like I needed, mileage, for lack of a better term.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

(description)

(evaluation comments)
Notes:
* Opportunity for more unit testing. Overall very strong testing suite, though. Strong 3
* Base and all extensions
* Node and Binary Search Tree classes, opportunity to add some other analytical modules/classes to manage analytical tasks
* Some long methods, overall solid/comfortable use of Ruby style/syntax
* Clean up file dependencies to run from top of project directory

(evaluation scores)
### 1. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
 
### 2. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions

### 3. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

(Intro)
Pairing on a project felt very comfortable for me.  In my last job I did a small amount of work with the developers and certainly was familiar with the idea of pair programming and what the mechanics were.  However, I had no idea how it would be to pair with one of my classmates for the first time.  I knew we would be stumbling through not only the mechanics and strategies of *how* to pair effectively, but also adding the challenges of using git effectively on our own and tackling an algorithm which was difficult for both of us to solve.  In the end, I feel like my partner and I complimented each other quite well with our individual strengths and weaknesses, and I believe our assessment shows the result of a successful partnership.

#### Complete Me

##### Complete Me 
Complete Me expanded on the Binary Search Tree project (Date Night) from the previous week and was the more general case of a tree with linked nodes.  While the Date Night project was one way to quickly store, filter and sort a list of numbers (scores and movie title), Complete Me was used to store words so that it could be used as an autocomplete system like might be used on a phone messaging app [like so](http://www.damnyouautocorrect.com/10484/the-top-15-most-popular-dyac-texts-of-all-time/).  Our project relied heavily on recursion.  

(evaluation comments)
* Really good job breaking out into logical components.
* Though there are small methods, looks like there is a bit of redundancy and
could combine multiple methods into one
* Tests are really great, but still a little redudancy here
* Liked the explicit returns in only the methods where it made sense
* Shoes extension is really neat


(evaluation scores)
### 1. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application always breaks concepts into classes and methods which encapsulate functionality.

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, refactoring, and extensively uses idiomatic code.

### 4. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods and collections

### 5. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

(feedback to me)
From Laszlo:

I very much enjoyed pairing with Nick on the Complete Me project. Nick has a strong work ethic and a very strong drive to deliver a high quality solution. Nick demonstrated great knowledge of GitHub and was great at sharing that knowledge as well as help me to improve with everything GitHub related. He is great at keeping a disciplined development approach that allowed us to build our project through iteration (test-code-refactor). I would be very happy to pair with Nick on any future projects and anybody who will pair with him will be very pleased with Nickâ€™s value add to the success of any future projects.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

D3 talk Lucy and I gave to Verou Posse
(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

(ways you supported the larger Turing community)
NE - e.g. helped your peers

feedback from Annie Wolff on GitHub help:
Nick, you are the first person I go to when I would like a thorough, un-judgmental 
answer to a stupid question. You have a deep understanding of GitHub and have
helped me right multiple gitastrophies. Each time I come to you with a problem, 
I leave with a better grasp of how to fix it myself in the future.

Thanks!


gave a talk on D3 on the second week
