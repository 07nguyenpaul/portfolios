# Nicholas Erhardt - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

This module I was looking forward to focusing on fundamentals.  By that I mean I was comfortable with the concept that Ruby can be used to to express a problem/solution, but I felt very much in the dark about *how* to organize code (classes, methods), what approach to take (where to start, how to think about breaking down the problem first) and [something else].  I also wanted to write a *lot* of code.  I felt like I needed, mileage, for lack of a better term.

(Intro)
Pairing on a project felt very comfortable for me.  In my last job I did a small amount of work with the developers and certainly was familiar with the idea of pair programming and what the mechanics were.  However, I had no idea how it would be to pair with one of my classmates for the first time.  I knew we would be stumbling through not only the mechanics and strategies of *how* to pair effectively, but also adding the challenges of using git effectively on our own and tackling an algorithm which was difficult for both of us to solve.  In the end, I feel like my partner and I complimented each other quite well with our individual strengths and weaknesses, and I believe our assessment shows the result of a successful partnership.

##### Complete Me 
Complete me expanded on the Binary Search Tree project (Date Night) from the previous week and was the more general case of a tree with linked nodes.  While the Date Night project was one way to quickly store, filter and sort a list of numbers (scores and movie title), Complete Me was used to store words so that it could be used as an autocomplete system like might be used on a phone messaging app [like so](http://www.damnyouautocorrect.com/10484/the-top-15-most-popular-dyac-texts-of-all-time/).  Our project relied heavily on recursion.
