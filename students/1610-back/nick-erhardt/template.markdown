# Nicholas Erhardt - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module I was looking forward to focusing on fundamentals.  By that I mean I was comfortable with the concept that Ruby can be used to to express a problem/solution, but I felt very much in the dark about *how* to organize code (e.g. classes, methods, etc...).  I knew I needed practice with what approach to take (where to start, how to think about breaking down the problem first) and what 'refactoring' actually looks like.  I also wanted to write a *lot* of code.  I felt like I needed... mileage, for lack of a better term.  One aspect I was looking forward to was the shared struggle of working through problems with my cohort-mates - learning with and from each other.

## B: Individual Work & Projects
NE - 2 projects

HTTP
#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/ski-climb/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

The heart of the HTTP project was to make a web server using Ruby.  We created and fired up a web server.  We created and parsed requests.  We sent responses based on the path and HTTP verb.  
HTTP was an eye-opening opportunity to make a web server using Ruby.  On one hand it was an *excellent* experience which exposed the fundamental processes and flow of a web server.  On the other hand it was a unique experiment in frustration and formatting which made me revel in the gloriousness of my web browser.  I also had no idea that information could be included in a web request in so many ways from query parmeters to POST key, values in forms.  

##### Evaluation Comments:
Notes:
* Great testing overall, used tmux to get around the server close test
* code was well organized, would have liked to have seen the word search pulled out
* Memoization in loading dictionary which is sweet


##### 1. Overall Functionality
* 2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3

##### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

##### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

##### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ski-climb/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

(description)

##### Evaluation Comments:
Notes:
* Opportunity for more unit testing. Overall very strong testing suite, though. Strong 3
* Base and all extensions
* Node and Binary Search Tree classes, opportunity to add some other analytical modules/classes to manage analytical tasks
* Some long methods, overall solid/comfortable use of Ruby style/syntax
* Clean up file dependencies to run from top of project directory

(evaluation scores)
##### 1. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
 
##### 2. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions

##### 3. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

##### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

(Intro)
Pairing on a project felt very comfortable for me.  In my last job I did a small amount of work with the developers and certainly was familiar with the idea of pair programming and what the mechanics were.  However, I had no idea how it would be to pair with one of my classmates for the first time.  I knew we would be stumbling through not only the mechanics and strategies of *how* to pair effectively, but also adding the challenges of using git effectively on our own and tackling an algorithm which was difficult for both of us to solve.  In the end, I feel like my partner and I complimented each other quite well with our individual strengths and weaknesses, and I believe our assessment shows the result of a successful partnership.

#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ski-climb/Complete-Me)
* [Assessment](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1610-b/complete_me/laszlo_nick.md)

(description)
##### Complete Me 
Complete Me expanded on the Binary Search Tree project (Date Night) from the previous week and was the more general case of a tree with linked nodes.  While the Date Night project was one way to quickly store, filter and sort a list of numbers (scores and movie title), Complete Me was used to store words so that it could be used as an autocomplete system like might be used on a phone messaging app [like so](http://www.damnyouautocorrect.com/10484/the-top-15-most-popular-dyac-texts-of-all-time/).  Our project relied heavily on recursion.  

(evaluation comments)
* Really good job breaking out into logical components.
* Though there are small methods, looks like there is a bit of redundancy and
could combine multiple methods into one
* Tests are really great, but still a little redudancy here
* Liked the explicit returns in only the methods where it made sense
* Shoes extension is really neat

(evaluation scores)
### 1. Test-Driven Development
* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases

### 2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application always breaks concepts into classes and methods which encapsulate functionality.

### 3. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, refactoring, and extensively uses idiomatic code.

### 4. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods and collections

### 5. Functional Expectations
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension

(feedback to me)
From Laszlo:

I very much enjoyed pairing with Nick on the Complete Me project. Nick has a strong work ethic and a very strong drive to deliver a high quality solution. Nick demonstrated great knowledge of GitHub and was great at sharing that knowledge as well as help me to improve with everything GitHub related. He is great at keeping a disciplined development approach that allowed us to build our project through iteration (test-code-refactor). I would be very happy to pair with Nick on any future projects and anybody who will pair with him will be very pleased with Nickâ€™s value add to the success of any future projects.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)
From me to Annie: 
Annie was great influence during Mod 1 and very helpful during the Black
Thursday project.  Throughout the module, she was cheerful and positive
(even in the face of greater challenges like Complete Me and, even worse,
voter registration after relocating to a new state).  And she was
especially generous with her time and as an extra brain to talk out the
intricacies of Black Thursday - even though she had already breezed past
the section that was tripping me up.  I appreciate her insight and hope to
get a chance to work with her on a project at Turing.

From me to Laszlo:
Laszlo was a fantastic pairing partner for Complete Me.  He brought a
thoughtful and consistent approach to testing our project.  His discipline
for seeking out edge cases from both the micro and macro levels of the application
demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the code base. The result was a robust
project that was also flexible and a very complete test suite.

Laszlo is also a tremendous communicator.  He was always open to listening to
and consider new ideas.  And in the end, whether the idea was acted on or
not, or he agreed with it or not, he would always give a well thought out,
reasoned response.  His communicative style and calm demeanor cultivated a
positive, safe environment in which to try out new approaches or test
various theories.  

Laszlo was amazing to work with, and I am truly looking forward to
partnering with him again.

### Being a Community Member

D3 talk Lucy and I gave to Verou Posse
(feedback to me)
NE - e.g. helped your peers

feedback from Annie Wolff on GitHub help:
Nick, you are the first person I go to when I would like a thorough, un-judgmental 
answer to a stupid question. You have a deep understanding of GitHub and have
helped me right multiple gitastrophies. Each time I come to you with a problem, 
I leave with a better grasp of how to fix it myself in the future.
Thanks!
