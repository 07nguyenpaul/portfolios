Notes:

More testing needed, tests written demonstrate basic grasp of testing principles, but coverage is insufficient
Health method missing

2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
2. Functional Expectations

2: Application is missing one base expectation
3. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
