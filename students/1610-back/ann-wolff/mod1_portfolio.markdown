# Ann Wolff - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

For this module, my main focuses were to grow in confidence as a ruby developer and to aclimate myself to life at Turing. Much of my energy went towards learning the material and doing good work on my projects, and I think that this work has helped me achieve my first goal. I feel that the work that I've done in this session has prepped me to jump into the challenges coming in the next module. I knew early on that I would find it challenging to admit when I am struggling, so I set goals early on to set up pairings and reach out for help early and often. This was instrumental to my ability to succeed and I am looking   forward to being able to give back to students who come in the next module. 

I hoped to join and contribute to a few groups and become an active member of the community. I think I could have worked harder to achieve this goal, but I have gotten a lot out of the groups I've joined. I have given presentations to my posse, attended many Imposter Lunches and become close friends with many of my classmates. I hope that moving forward, I can be an even more active member of the community.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

This secton describes the individual projects that I worked on in Module One. It includes links to the projects assignments, details about my evaluations and links to my repository.

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

For this project, I built a binary search tree to store movie reccomemendations for a hypothetical date night. As a class, we discussed the advantages of a tree structure over linear search in relation to Big O anyalsis. My algorithm creates a tree where each node has two children that are inserted based on their numerical value in relation to their parent. This creates a more efficient search where the worst case scenerio that takes much less time to run. 

The program features methods that can insert individual movies, as well as load entire text files. It can also query the tree to determine the maximum and minimum values, as well as whether a particular rating is already in the tree and its depth within it.

Notes:

More testing needed, tests written demonstrate basic grasp of testing principles, but coverage is insufficient
Health method missing
Many long methods, nested elsif statements, opportunities to refactor

Score:

1. Test-Driven Development

  2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

2. Functional Expectations

  2: Application is missing one base expectation

3. Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
  
#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This section includes details about the projects I worked on with at least one other partner. It includes descriptions of the assignments, links to our repositories, details about our evaluations, feedback we received and links to our DTRs. 

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)
* [Partner DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wuEe-HlkuZ2Vuekzhvack4-OKVn6lAeRtFH42NLjNrU/edit)

For this project, my partner and I built a directed network search that functions as an auto-complete application. It can load a dictionary that then provides suggestions from a word stem provided by the user. The suggestions are weighted based on selection frequency by the specific string provided.

Notes:

Tests have some failures after refactoring and removing methods
Tests are very detailed and closely tied to implementation
Haven't used the spec harness
Implementation is strong but could use more abstractions
Good code for refactoring with a mentor
Keep the "language" of the app consistent unless it needs to be different
Spec harness passes
Scores:

1. Test-Driven Development

  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

4. Enumerable & Collections

  3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections

5. Functional Expectations

  3: Application fulfills all base expectations

#### BlackThursday

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/black_thursday)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)
* [Partner DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q5F5tmlT4mkO0JdqqU0Ahs9plPnyAVXuLNIoEPEQyxQ/edit?usp=sharing)

In this project, we worked with large csv files containing ecommerce data. We built a program that parsed the data and created objects that interacted to show detailed information about the merchants, customers, and the items that have been purchased. We provide a class that preforms analytics on the dataset to provide meaningful interpretation of the data.

## D: Professional Skills
This section includes details about the programs we participate that address issues in the tech industry and teach us professional skills to help us as we leave Turing. 

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This discussion focused on the importance of active citizenship and the role that voting plays in upholding these responsibilies. The readings also probed America's low voter turn-out and the difficulties many voters have in receiving high quality information about issues on the ballot. I was surprised by the strong anti-voting feelings that these discussions brought up. Many doubted the actual power that their voice had in the democracy, but I was convinced by the argument that a democracy depends on its citizens to be effective. 

#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

I valued the reminder that people come from all different perspectives and attitudes. I am a very strong extrovert and so was a little surprised by the views that my introverted classmates held. It seemed like the small group was a place where they could express how they felt about much of the personal development that we do.

#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

I have many people in my life who model amazing resilience, so this topic is very important to me. In our small group, we discussed what resilience means at Turing and how to support our cohort-mates in their ability to frame challenges as oppurtunities for growth. I was reminded of the importance of developing this attitude in difficult situations and will continue to work towards greater resilience. 

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Personal Branding

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annie-wolff)

In this workshop, we learned techniques to present our selfs and our stories in a light that reccommends us to employers. We learned about what to put on a resume and how to use LinkedIn to passively connect with people to potentially network with.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

"Annie! Thanks so much for always setting up opportunities for our cohort to hang out. You make decisions for the group without being overbearing, and it definitely strengthens our bond. Putting the Wolff in Wolffpack!" -Mike Shutte


### Playing a Part

Although I still feel that I can continue to grow into my role as a community member at Turing, I've been able to give back in some rewarding ways. As a member of the Verou posse, I led a discussion on Bootstrap that covered its benefits and drawbacks. I have also been able to attend many of their meetings and be an engaged member of thr group. I've also become a regular of Imposter Lunches, where we support each other or just provide an oppurtunity to not stress about school work.

Within our own cohort, we have begun to build our own close community and support system. Amara Lovato and Lucy Conklin and I have arranged a weekly happy hour on Thursdays that has been a great opportunity to become closer and learn new things about everyone in our cohort. Many members of our class have families or live far outside of town, so it has been wonderful to have a time when we can plan on being together and unwind after a stressful week.
