## B: Individual Work & Projects

This secton describes the individual projects that I worked on and includes links to the assignments and my code.

#### Date Night

* [My Code](https://github.com/wlffann/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

For this project, I built a binary search tree to store movie reccomemendations for a hypothetical date night. As a class, we discussed the advantages of a tree structure over linear search in relation to Big O anyalsis. My algorithm creates a tree where each node has two children that are inserted based on their numerical value in relation to their parent. This creates a more efficient search where the worst case scenerio that takes much less time to run. 

The program features methods that can insert individual movies, as well as load entire text files. It can also query the tree to determine the maximum and minimum values, as well as whether a particular rating is already in the tree and its depth within it.

Notes:

More testing needed, tests written demonstrate basic grasp of testing principles, but coverage is insufficient
Health method missing
Many long methods, nested elsif statements, opportunities to refactor

Score:

1. Test-Driven Development

  2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

2. Functional Expectations

  2: Application is missing one base expectation

3. Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [Discussion Prompt](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This discussion focused on the importance of active citizenship and the role that voting plays in upholding these responsibilies. The readings also probed America's low voter turn-out and the difficulties many voters have in receiving high quality information about issues on the ballot. I was surprised by the strong anti-voting feelings that these discussions brought up. Many doubted the actual power that their voice had in the democracy, but I was convinced by the argument that a democracy depends on its citizens to be effective.
