## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

This secton describes the individual projects that I worked on in Module One. It includes links to the projects assignments, details about my evaluations and links to my repository.

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

For this project, I built a binary search tree to store movie reccomemendations for a hypothetical date night. As a class, we discussed the advantages of a tree structure over linear search in relation to Big O anyalsis. My algorithm creates a tree where each node has two children that are inserted based on their numerical value in relation to their parent. This creates a more efficient search where the worst case scenerio that takes much less time to run. 

The program features methods that can insert individual movies, as well as load entire text files. It can also query the tree to determine the maximum and minimum values, as well as whether a particular rating is already in the tree and its depth within it.

Notes:

More testing needed, tests written demonstrate basic grasp of testing principles, but coverage is insufficient
Health method missing
Many long methods, nested elsif statements, opportunities to refactor

Score:

1. Test-Driven Development

  2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

2. Functional Expectations

  2: Application is missing one base expectation

3. Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes which encapsulate functionality. (SRP).

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines), has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
  
#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

 

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This section includes details about the projects I worked on with at least one other partner. It includes descriptions of the assignments, links to our repositories, details about our evaluations, feedback we received and links to our DTRs. 

#### CompleteMe

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/wlffann/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

For this project, my partner and I built a directed network search that functions as an auto-complete application. It can load a dictionary that then provides suggestions from a word stem provided by the user. The suggestions are weighted based on selection frequency by the specific string provided.

Notes:

Tests have some failures after refactoring and removing methods
Tests are very detailed and closely tied to implementation
Haven't used the spec harness
Implementation is strong but could use more abstractions
Good code for refactoring with a mentor
Keep the "language" of the app consistent unless it needs to be different
Spec harness passes
Scores:

1. Test-Driven Development

  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

2. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

  3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

4. Enumerable & Collections

  3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections

5. Functional Expectations

  3: Application fulfills all base expectations

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [Discussion Prompt](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

This discussion focused on the importance of active citizenship and the role that voting plays in upholding these responsibilies. The readings also probed America's low voter turn-out and the difficulties many voters have in receiving high quality information about issues on the ballot. I was surprised by the strong anti-voting feelings that these discussions brought up. Many doubted the actual power that their voice had in the democracy, but I was convinced by the argument that a democracy depends on its citizens to be effective.

(3-4 sentences summarizing your takeaways from _each_ session, including things you're continuing to think about, things you learned, things you're doing differently)


### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Session Name)


* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/module_one/personal_branding_p1.md)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annie-wolff)

In this workshop, we learned techniques to present our selfs and our stories in a light that reccommends us to employers. We learned about what to put on a resume and how to use LinkedIn to passively connect with people to potentially network with.
