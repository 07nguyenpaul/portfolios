Drew Palazzari - Module 1 Portfolio

Areas of Emphasis

My first goal this module was, as Jeff said, to survive. I did not, however want to survive by accomplishing the bare minimum. 
I want to become the best programmer in the Ruby language. To achieve this: 1)I will try my absolute best not to fall behind,
2) I will get help from pairings when I need it, 3) I will be honest about my inabilities as well as my best abilities, and 
4) I will strive to enjoy my time here at Turing and to try to have fun learning a new computer language. It's exciting, 
depsite the challnge.

B: Individual Work & Projects

Individual projects were very challenging. They test your ability to access knowledge, and understand it. Overall, I am 
pleased with the results of my individual projects.

MASTERMIND

https://github.com/Dpalazzari/Mastermind
Mastermind markdown: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown

The purpose of this project was to build a working Ruby-programmed version of the game, Mastermind. The student was expected
to demonstrate adequate use of Ruby flow mechanics, logical use of TDD and REPL, 'good code', and the student's ability to 
build a multi-part complex, working, game.

Evaluation scores:

1) Test Driven Development
  score: 2 : Application tests some components but has many gaps in coverage.
2) REPL Interface and Game Functionality
  score: 3 : Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations 
  from the project spec.
3) Breaking Logic into Components
  score: 2.5 : Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  score: 3 :Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines)
  needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.
5) Enumerable & Collections
   score: 3 :Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections.
   
Personal analysis of Mastermind: I need to focus on improving my TDD skills, first off. I built Mastermind without tests
and then went back after it worked and fruitlessly tried to test it. This is a very difficult way to write a program. Second,
I can do better at organizing my code in an easier-to-read fashion. My Mastermind game had methods everywhere, and it wasn't
always clear where other methods were that were being called in a different method. It was hard for anyone but me to navigate.
Also, I need to spend more time refactoring. I had a couple methods that were just enormously large. I should strive to make
more, smaller methods in my classes. 

Things to learn:
1) TDD
2) implementing multiple classes
3) understanding input/output
4) Hash methods.


C: Group Work & Projects

NightWriter/NightReader

https://github.com/Dpalazzari/NightWriter
NightWriter markdown: https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown

project pairing: Edilene

The purpose of this project was to pair with a classmate, and create a program that could read a text file and then write that
text to a new file, translated in braille. It was required to read in braille and write to english, as well. First, we had
to build the writer and reader scripts. Then we built two translators. One for english to braille, and the other for braille to
english. We stored the languages in a hash.

D: Professional Skills

(Intro)

Gear Up

Vote Your Conscience
markdown: https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown

It was an interesting session, talking about the outside factors that influence people to vote. I chose to pursue topic 2:
Information Intermediaries. There was certainly a diversity of famous people who support either candidate. To be honest, that
means nothing to me. Celebrities and entertainers are known for their ability to perform/entertain. They aren't professional
politicians so I really do not take anything they say to heart. I will listen, but usually I do not pay attention. The number
one thing I took away from this gear up was that there are people with legit reasons on both sides of the line who choose their
side for one reason or another. It is always beneficial to concede, and relate that some of the things the opposition say are
true. That may or may not influence my vote, but if I can read into proven facts, then I am an informed voter and I can vote
my conscience. At the end of the day, the decision to vote or not or for a particular candidate comes down to the individual.
Hopefully most people do not let the sole input of famous people's influence sway their decisions to vote.
