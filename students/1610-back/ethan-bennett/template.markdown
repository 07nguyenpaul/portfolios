# Ethan Bennett - Module 1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals have shifted a little as this module has progressed--at first, I just wanted to learn as much as I possibly could. Now (as of the third week), I'm more focused on drilling in the fundamentals.

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Night Writer

* https://github.com/ethanbennett/night-writer
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown

Night Writer is a program designed to translate English characters into Braille characters. Each Braille character is a grid of six dots or zeroes, with the zeroes representing the raised dots. Since a single Braille character six-dot rectangle, the translation involved some difficult formatting problems. The input (English or Braille text) is extracted directly from a .txt file, and the program creates a new .txt file containing the translated output. The user runs the program by calling night_writer.rb for English-to-Braille or night_reader.rb for the reverse, and it's fed two arguments: the first being the existing .txt file to be translated, and the second being a the desired file-name for the translated output.

Notes:

    19 tests - all passing
    Decent refactoring to be done
    functioning with an extension
    talked about variables at length


Scores:
1. Test-Driven Development

  2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
  
2. Breaking Logic into Components


    3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

4. Overall Functionality

    3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension
