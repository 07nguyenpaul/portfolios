# Ethan Bennett - Module 1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals have shifted a little as this module has progressed--at first, I just wanted to learn as much as I possibly could. Now (as of the third week), I'm more focused on drilling in the fundamentals.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

After completing my two individual projects, I've seen the strengths I expected to display both improve and be reinforced. Coming from a writing background, I hoped to see my composition and editing skills translate to eloquent Ruby style, efficient refactoring, and logical structures--and I think it did. I also intuited, after Mastermind, that testing would be my most difficult area, and that's also been accurate. I'm comfortable with the material, but I suspect I'll see some major improvement on my next paired project (Black Thursday).

#### Mastermind

* https://github.com/ethanbennett/mastermind
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown

Mastermind is a simple color guessing game. The user runs it from the command line, and the program generates a combination for the user to guess. In the context of my other work, it's a great example of how far I've come in testing, enumerable use, breaking problems into logical components, and general Ruby style.

Assessed by: Ilana
Notes:

    Mastermind and Player Input class
    Player input has 5 tests and mastermind test suite not running
    Talked about seperation of responsibility => making multiple classes to handle responbility
    Talked about creating methods that could intake variables instead of creating instance variables.

Scores:
1. Test-Driven Development

    1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

    4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

3. Breaking Logic into Components

    2.5: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

5. Enumerable & Collections

    1: Application does not use enumerables.

#### HTTP

* https://github.com/ethanbennett/http
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown

HTTP started with building a server in Ruby. It also had to include specific paths, with unique outputs on the page for each path. I didn't get through all the verb functions, so my scores on this project aren't my highest. I do think it shows significant improvement in the areas I hoped to improve, however--particularly in style and the logical components. The testing was weaker on this one as well, but the score reflects a "scaling up" of testing capabilities. I would argue the tests still display a remarkable level of coverage compared with the projects I'd completed up to this point, and despite its lower scores, I think it's the highest-quality code I've written yet (by a long shot).

Assessed by: Ilana
Notes:

    17 tests - all passing
    tests need to be more robust
    some general methods that we talked about including the output and headers method in the output class
    
Scores: 
1. Overall Functionality

    2: Application implements iterations 0 - 3

Echo/Foxtrot Note: Requirements listed are for Foxtrot pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5
2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development

    2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

4. Breaking Logic into Components

    4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage




## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Night Writer

* https://github.com/ethanbennett/night-writer
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown

Night Writer is a program designed to translate English characters into Braille characters. Each Braille character is a grid of six dots or zeroes, with the zeroes representing the raised dots. Since a single Braille character six-dot rectangle, the translation involved some difficult formatting problems. The input (English or Braille text) is extracted directly from a .txt file, and the program creates a new .txt file containing the translated output. The user runs the program by calling night_writer.rb for English-to-Braille or night_reader.rb for the reverse, and it's fed two arguments: the first being the existing .txt file to be translated, and the second being a the desired file-name for the translated output.

Assessed By: Ilana
Notes:

    19 tests - all passing
    Decent refactoring to be done
    functioning with an extension
    talked about variables at length


Scores:
1. Test-Driven Development

        2.5: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
  
2. Breaking Logic into Components


        3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

3. Fundamental Ruby & Style

        3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

4. Overall Functionality

        3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension
