## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Date Night - Individual Project One

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/akintner/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

For Date Night, we were tasked with creating a Binary Search Tree that would accept insertions in the form of a movie and a score. These movies and scores would populate the tree with nodes to the left and the right, with the first submission acting as a root node from which all other nodes would stem. Each new movie and score would be vetted against scores and titles already present in the tree and would then be inserted accordingly (i.e. to the right if the score was higher and not already present, to the left if the score was lower and not already present, and not at all if the title was already present). 

Commentary about the evaluation: Overall, the experince was much less terrifiying than I'd prepped myself to believe; I enjoyed the review process and got some great advice from Beth about refactoring methods. I was hoping and expecting to get a 3 for my testing suite, which I didn't. This was upsetting simply because I misunderstood the testing protocols and had interpreted the phrase "balance of isolation and integration tests" to mean that I tested some methods individually, but tested some things together, i.e. integrate some of the tests to account for multiple things at once. I got dinged for having tests that did too many things in a single test, however, since what integration testing was not explicitely made clear until the second TDD lesson in the third week, I feel I was unfairly judged against a rubric that wasn't clear.

#### HTTP - Individual Project Two

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/akintner/HTTP)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

For HTTP, we were tasked with creating a web server that would accept GET and POST requests from a localhost.

Commentary about the evaluation: This project was the most frustrating so far for me for a giant variety of reasons: first off, my pairing session on Tuesday got cancelled becuase the Mod 2 paid said she couldn't help me with this project at all because she'd not yet done anything like it. Second off, as per my calculations, we only had a maximum of 20-29 total hours to work on this project over the course of three days (this is assuming that a person sleeps between 4 and 7 hours a night), and for most of us it was actually something far less. I got the first two iterations set up on Monday night, but they were ugly. I then spent the better part of Tuesday and Wendesday refactoring into nice classes and methods, only to realize on Wednesday afternoon around 4 PM - with the aid of three Mod 4 students - that the refactoring had caused bugs that NONE of us could track down. At that point, I resorted back to the ugly stuff that worked from Monday and moved forward. Because of the time lag for me, I didn't get all the functionality there (even though I almost figured out the JSON extension for the word search).

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects



#### Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kheppenstall/complete_me/tree/master)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

For Complete Me - our first paired project at Turing - the echo group was working to popular a Trie with words from a dictionary (the entirety of which contained 260,000 words. From a root node, the tree would popular words into an effectively unlimited number of subsidiary nodes, each of which contained a letter and links to other letters. Traversing these nodes would ultimately end with letters that terminated a word and be indicated as such. The program could suggest words, given a fragment, and also delete words from the dictionary by removing all links between letters of that word. 

Commentary from the evaluation: We rocked this project. I was super happy with how it worked out, and since we'd run the spec harness in advance, Jeff seemed very pleased with everything. Kyle and I were both very happy with the way everything turned out; it was an amazing first pairing project for me.

* Jeff's evaluation (https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1610-b/complete_me/kyle_amy.md)

In our project retro, Kyle and I both agreed that we worked well together and our project was successful as a result. The issue he said could probably use improvement was the fact that we decided to do the insert and count methods separately over the weekend, then spend Sunday night discussing what we achieved on Screenehro, and spend Monday afternoon and after school re-writing the entire program from scratch. In retrospect, Kyle feels it may have been better to have done more work together, perhaps especially the creation of a testing suite, as early as Friday and THEN have moved forward over the weekend with the assurance that our lanague would at least be similar when creating our insert and count methods. I agree, and we both think outlining and making a testing suite before we start the next project will be super helpful. Additionally, Kyle thanked me for the level of friendly communication we had before we started each pairing session and said it helped to establish some small level of friendship before we dug into work every day.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Kyle and I worked on the first paired project together, Complete Me, and overall it was an amazing experience. Our work and communicaiton styles are clearly similar, and our ability to do work together was complemented by these similarities. One thing that could be improved, from my perspective, was continuing to outline goals for each evening of the week it was due. Over the weekend, we set explicit goals and both achieved them, but after our first pairing session Monday night, we never re-set goals each day, so I spent some evenings wondering what I should be doing and feeling like I wasn't accomplishing much. In the end, our project ended up being a tremendous success, and these evening of solo work and research helped both of us achieve a very streamlined end result, but it may be better going foward to outline more explicit goals and communicate them in advance each day. Communicaiton between the two of us during pairing sessions was excellent, we shared space and computer consoles very well, and I look forward to working with Kyle again in the future at Turing.
