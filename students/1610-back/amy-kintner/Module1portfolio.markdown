## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Date Night - Individual Project One

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/akintner/Date-Night-echo-first-project-)
* [Original Assignment](curriculum/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Date Night is a project in which we were tasked with creating a Binary Search Tree that would accept insertions in the form of a movie and a score. These movies and scores would populate the tree with nodes to the left and the right, with the first submission acting as a root node from which all other nodes would stem. Each new movie and score would be vetted against scores and titles already present in the tree and would then be inserted accordingly (i.e. to the right if the score was higher and not already present, to the left if the score was lower and not already present, and not at all if the title was already present).
