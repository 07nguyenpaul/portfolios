## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Date Night - Individual Project One

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/akintner/Date-Night-echo-first-project-)
* [Original Assignment](curriculum/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Date Night is a project for which we were tasked with creating a Binary Search Tree that would accept insertions in the form of a movie and a score. These movies and scores would populate the tree with nodes to the left and the right, with the first submission acting as a root node from which all other nodes would stem. Each new movie and score would be vetted against scores and titles already present in the tree and would then be inserted accordingly (i.e. to the right if the score was higher and not already present, to the left if the score was lower and not already present, and not at all if the title was already present).

In our project retro, Kyle and I both agreed that we worked well together and our project was successful as a result. The issue he said could probably use improvement was the fact that we decided to do the insert and count methods separately over the weekend, then spend Sunday night discussing what we achieved on Screenehro, and spend Monday afternoon and after school re-writing the entire program from scratch. In retrospect, Kyle feels it may have been better to have done more work together, perhaps especially the creation of a testing suite, as early as Friday and THEN have moved forward over the weekend with the assurance that our lanague would at least be similar when creating our insert and count methods. I agree, and we both think outlining and making a testing suite before we start the next project will be super helpful. Additionally, Kyle thanked me for the level of friendly communication we had before we started each pairing session and said it helped to establish some small level of friendship before we dug into work every day.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Kyle and I worked on the first paired project together, Complete Me, and overall it was an amazing experience. Our work and communicaiton styles are clearly similar, and our ability to do work together was complemented by these similarities. One thing that could be improved, from my perspective, was continuing to outline goals for each evening of the week it was due. Over the weekend, we set explicit goals and both achieved them, but after our first pairing session Monday night, we never re-set goals each day, so I spent some evenings wondering what I should be doing and feeling like I wasn't accomplishing much. In the end, our project ended up being a tremendous success, and these evening of solo work and research helped both of us achieve a very streamlined end result, but it may be better going foward to outline more explicit goals and communicate them in advance each day. Communicaiton between the two of us during pairing sessions was excellent, we shared space and computer consoles very well, and I look forward to working with Kyle again in the future at Turing.
