## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?
When I first began, I didn't know what I didn't know, but I knew I wanted to strengthen my logical skills and build a good foundation with Ruby and object oriented-programming. Whereas the logic part is quite simple for me, I needed to become more comfortable with testing, and have spent a lot of time throughout this module to become more comfortable with TDD.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

In this module, I worked on the following individual projects: Mastermind;

#### Mastermind

* https://github.com/MarisaMBurton/mastermind
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown

Build a playable game of Mastermind that runs in a REPL interface. TDD is important.

I personally struggled with TDD and how to organize this project, as it was my first. Now I'm getting a better understanding of TDD and how to properly build and use classes.

Notes:

-didn't make use of strong TDD
-a lot was inside the mastermind class, think about what and how you could put things into separate classes When thinking about how to divide things into separate classes, name things that the class does in english whenever you use "and" that's probably a good sign you can pull it out. Example, the mastermind class has the things you print out to the screen AND checks the inputs from the user AND ... etc etc
-Methods created to check user input were great
Score:

1. Test-Driven Development: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality
3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec
3. Breaking Logic into Components
2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
5. Enumerable & Collections
3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections

#### NightWriter

* https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/NightWriter
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown

Write a program that converts a braille text to English and an English text to braille.

Notes:

Rake test file
26 tests 749 assertions
100 percent test coverage
used in enumerables in test
Recursive approach was super cool
Read and write are separated, might belong together in a single class/module/thing
try to have methods take arguments instead of reading an instance variable
Scores:

Test-Driven Development--4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases

Breaking Logic into Components--3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

Fundamental Ruby & Style--3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

Overall Functionality--3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Rock the Vote
I really enjoyed hearing everyone's different perspectives, as we all come from such different backgrounds and have such different life experiences. I'm contemplating about the balance between America's problems and how lucky I am to have been born here. Our democracy is not perfect, but is functional, and I have many personal freedoms here I would not have in other countries, especially as a woman. Just having the privilege to be in a program like Turing keeps my "first world problems" in check.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Session Name)

Personal Branding I: The resume/cover letter workshop was really helpful. I updated my cover letter and rebuilt and redesigned my resume as well as created a LinkedIn page following the advice given. It made me take a more analytical approach to how I represent and brand myself to stand out from other software developers. The session motivated me and got me excited about the possibilities outside of Turing.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

I am on the studen advisory board, where I go to weekly meetings and try to represent my cohort as much as possible.

In my first module, I paired a lot with upper-module students, and try to the best of my ability help my fellow cohort students with their programming problems.

I also participate in the Armstrong possee concerning regression analysis.
