Marisa Burton - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?
When I first began, I didn't know what I didn't know, but I knew I wanted to strengthen my logical skills and build a good foundation with Ruby and object oriented-programming. Whereas the logic part is quite simple for me, I needed to become more comfortable with testing, and have spent a lot of time throughout this module to become more comfortable with TDD.
