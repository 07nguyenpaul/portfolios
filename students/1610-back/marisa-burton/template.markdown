## Marisa Burton - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

#### What did you set out to accomplish this module?

When I first began, I didn't know what I didn't know, but I knew I wanted to strengthen my logical skills and build a good foundation with Ruby and object oriented-programming. Whereas the logic part is quite simple for me, I needed to become more comfortable with testing, and have spent a lot of time throughout this module to become more comfortable with TDD. I'd  like to work more on how objects interact with each other.

-----------------------

## A: End of Module Assessment

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress
* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration
* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

#### 6. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods


## B: Individual Work & Projects

In this module, I worked on the following individual projects: Mastermind.

#### Mastermind

* https://github.com/MarisaMBurton/mastermind
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown


Build a playable game of Mastermind that runs in a REPL interface. TDD is important.

I personally struggled with TDD and how to organize this project, as it was my first. Now I'm getting a better understanding of TDD and how to properly build and use classes.

Notes:

-didn't make use of strong TDD
-a lot was inside the mastermind class, think about what and how you could put things into separate classes When thinking about how to divide things into separate classes, name things that the class does in english whenever you use "and" that's probably a good sign you can pull it out. Example, the mastermind class has the things you print out to the screen AND checks the inputs from the user AND ... etc etc
-Methods created to check user input were great
Score:

1. Test-Driven Development: 
* 1--Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
2. REPL Interface and Game Functionality
3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec
3. Breaking Logic into Components
2: Application makes use of some classes, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) has poorly named variables, needs significant refactoring, and is somewhat idiomatic.
5. Enumerable & Collections
3: Application makes use of appropriate Enumerable methods and collections


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

The following projects were completed with a partner: Nightwriter & Black Thursday.

#### NightWriter

* https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/NightWriter
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown
* DTR: https://gist.github.com/Robbie-Smith/b5e3eaf605c04b9273cb04248089e236

Write a program that converts a braille text to English and an English text to braille.

Notes:

Rake test file
26 tests 749 assertions
100 percent test coverage
used in enumerables in test
Recursive approach was super cool
Read and write are separated, might belong together in a single class/module/thing
try to have methods take arguments instead of reading an instance variable
Scores:

Test-Driven Development--4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data, including edge cases

Breaking Logic into Components--3: Application consistently breaks concepts into classes and methods which have appropriate scope and responsibilities (SRP).

Fundamental Ruby & Style--3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) needs some refactoring, and is mostly idiomatic.

Overall Functionality--3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Rock the Vote
I really liked hearing everyone's different perspectives, as we all come from such different backgrounds and have such different life experiences. I'm contemplating about the balance between America's problems and how lucky I am to have been born here. Our democracy is not perfect, but is functional, and I have many personal freedoms here I would not have in other countries, especially as a woman. Just having the privilege to be in a program like Turing keeps my "first world problems" in check.

#### Introvert
I really enjoyed this gear-up. I realized that I've had more extroverted bosses that don't really understand how to get the best work out of me since I don't go out of my way to look for praise. My extroverted bosses have tended to try to micomanage me in that past, and I tend to do better being left to my own responsibilities. I do feel that Turing sometimes favors extroverts since there is a lot of group work, and sometimes I just need alone time to reinforce and process what I just learned before breaking off into groups and immediately working with other people.

#### Resilience
This topic got me thinking a lot about my past life experiences and how I can relate overcoming them to the stress I encounter at Turing. I liked the idea how resilience was internal and based upon how we frame problems. It’s a matter of thinking that you have control over your life and your emotions, instead of feeling out of control in a constant state of rumination, which I think I can sometimes be guilty of. An event does not become traumatic until one ruminates about it and doesn’t let it go; if one looks at an event as a learning experience where one can get knocked down and back up again, then one is more likely to be resilient and push through. Although resilience can be taught, I do believe there are genetic components, as some people are more genetically inclined to be sensitive or inclined toward depressive rumination than others. But that still doesn't mean I can't re-teach myself how to think and from what perspective I should view events or stressful situations. It gives me a bit of hope I can get through Turing, which requires a bit of grit and resilience, and anything else life may throw at me.


### Professional Sessions

Personal Branding I: The resume/cover letter workshop was really helpful. I updated my cover letter and rebuilt and redesigned my resume as well as created a LinkedIn page following the advice given. It made me take a more analytical approach to how I represent and brand myself to stand out from other software developers. The session motivated me and got me excited about the possibilities outside of Turing. I completed my LinkedIn profile  and will continue to update it with my relevant skills once I learn more. I'm still wondering how much of my past work experience I should put on my LinkedIn profile vs putting it on my resume, as I prefer to focus on my software-developer-experience on my LinkedIn profile. I will seek advice concerning this. LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/marisa-burton-14281a130?trk=hp-identity-name 


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to Brett Rivers:
"Brett was extremely helpful. He spent much of his free time pairing with me and is a natural teacher, walking me through how I should approach a problem step-by-step, asking questions so that I would reach my own conclusions. He always made sure I was learning throughout the pairing process so that I could emerge a stronger programmer. He's also a great person to talk to concerning expectations and calming my nerves."

#### Feedback to Robbie Smith:
"Robbie was a pleasure to work with and was understanding and patient when dealing with my gaps in knowledge. He is a strong programmer, who easily sees patterns and has strong organizational skills. Robbie explained himself well, walking me through every step of his thinking and programming process. He even spent his free time helping me with drills so that I can become a stronger programmer."

#### Feedback to Daniel Rodriguez:


### Being a Community Member

#### Feedback from Robbie Smith: 
"Marisa was a pleasure to work with during the Night Writer project. I really appreciated her flexibility and willingness to put in long hours over the weekened to work on the project. Her humility was much appreciated, and she was quick to speak up when she did not understand an issue. This allowed us as a group to work on the areas that she needed and allowed us both to focus on our learning process together."

### Playing a Part

I am on the studen advisory board, where I go to weekly meetings and try to represent my cohort as much as possible.

In my first module, I paired a lot with upper-module students, and try to the best of my ability help my fellow cohort students with their programming problems.

I also participate in the Armstrong and Golick possees, and have developed a good relationship with my mentor who I meet with weekly to two times a week.
