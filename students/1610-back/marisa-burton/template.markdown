Marisa Burton - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module?
When I first began, I didn't know what I didn't know, but I knew I wanted to strengthen my logical skills and build a good foundation with Ruby and object oriented-programming. Whereas the logic part is quite simple for me, I needed to become more comfortable with testing, and have spent a lot of time throughout this module to become more comfortable with TDD.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

In this module, I worked on the following individual projects: Mastermind;

#### Mastermind

* https://github.com/MarisaMBurton/mastermind
* https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown

Build a playable game of Mastermind that runs in a REPL interface. TDD is important.

I personally struggled with TDD and how to organize this project, as it was my first.

(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Rock the Vote
I really enjoyed hearing everyone's different perspectives, as we all come from such different backgrounds and have such different life experiences. I'm contemplating about the balance between America's problems and how lucky I am to have been born here. Our democracy is not perfect, but is functional, and I have many personal freedoms here I would not have in other countries, especially as a woman. Just having the privilege to be in a program like Turing keeps my "first world problems" in check.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### (Session Name)

Personal Branding I: The resume/cover letter workshop was really helpful. I updated my cover letter and rebuilt and redesigned my resume as well as created a LinkedIn page following the advice given. It made me take a more analytical approach to how I represent and brand myself to stand out from other software developers. The session motivated me and got me excited about the possibilities outside of Turing.

### Playing a Part

I am on the studen advisory board, where I go to weekly meetings and try to represent my cohort as much as possible.

In my first module, I paired a lot with upper-module students, and try to the best of my ability help my fellow cohort students with their programming problems.

I also participate in the Armstrong possee concerning regression analysis.
