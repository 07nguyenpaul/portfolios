# Chris Ceantiempo - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Prior to starting Turing, I had moderate programming experience writing small scripts for work and school. However, I had no experience with Object Oriented Programming and Test-Driven Development. To prepare for Turing I completed two Pragmatic Studios Courses including an Introduction to Ruby and Custom Blocks/Iterators courses. In addition, I completed a ruby tutorial on Code Academy.

Coming into the first module I wanted to focus on Test-Driven Development. The whole idea of testing something that didn't even exist seemed like a very abstract concept. The first couple weeks in the module I felt a little lost, especially when I was given the Robodoku project. It wasn't until nearing the end of the Chisel Project that I started to understand TDD. I ended up having to rewrite the whole project the night before. If I had not written tests, I would not have been able to complete the project. I've now grown to love TDD and see the importance of having tests.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on time, with the exception of being tardy on 8/11/2015.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Chisel
* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/ChrisCenatie/chisel)
* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

In this project I built code that parses markdown files and returns it in a file formatted in html.

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Linked Lists
* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/ChrisCenatie/linked_lists)
* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

In this project I built a linked list data structure.

"Great node testing" -Mike Dao

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3.5
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3.5
* Looping / Recursion: 3.5

#### Game of Life
* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/ChrisCenatie/game_of_life)
* [Original Assignment] (http://today.turing.io/outlines/2015-07-30/)

In this project I built the John Conway's game of life.

"Hey this is pretty good" - Austen Ito

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Enigma
* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/Jpease1020/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

 Encryption engine for encrypting, decrypting, and cracking messages.

"Pretty good abstractions" - Josh Cheek

* Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Sales Engine
* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/selfup/sales_engine)
* [Original Assignment] (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sales_engine.markdown)

1. Functional Expectations
* Base expectations met with time to spare.
  3: Application fulfills all base expectations as tested by the spec harness

2. Test-Driven Development
* Well tested with creative assertions for edge cases.
  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation
  and integration using appropriate data

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* Some code was duplicated, but the program shows a good use of modules and SRP.
  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the
  principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* Some mistakes were made, but overall Ruby was impressive.
  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and
  refactoring

5. Enumerable & Collections
* A few too many enumerables when simpler solutions could have sufficed. The
  enumerables were not nested, and were implemented precisely.
  3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

6. Code Sanitation
  4: Zero complaints

### Feedback Given to Me

Has been one of my go-tos for help this module.  Your sudo coding help of the crack in Enigma saved me.  I'm always impressed by how you understand the material and are able to express it all so understandably.

You really do have a good grasp on this stuff.

## Goals Moving Forward

In addition to learning and applying new skills, I plan on taking part community events going forward, including:

* Lightning Talks
* Creating a personal website
* Delivering a student-led session
* Helping organize community events
