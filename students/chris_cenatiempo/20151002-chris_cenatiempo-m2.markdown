# Chris Cenatiempo - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Prior to the module my goal was to dive deeper into how to work through both the front-end and the back-end. In addition to my goal of attaining more technical knowledge, I've wanted to try to discover the areas of programming where I excel. Understanding where I best fit in will not only help me with contributing to group projects, but also help me understand the best position for me.

### End of Module Assessment
Testing was generally good
Had some problems with Rails helpers (specifically. But MVC knowledge was good)

1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking
3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library
3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

3. Rails Syntax & API
3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

4. Rails Style
3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

5. Testing
3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

6. Collaboration
3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process


### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### TrafficSpy
* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/mbburch/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment] (http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/traffic_spy.html)

In this project we created a sinatra app to build a web app for web tracking and analysis. I wrote code for a lot of the back-end and the back-end code for the extension of registering and viewing campaigns.

### Feedback Given to Me
#### From Traffic-Spy
* Has awesome ideas! Great at admitting when something is wrong, but his ideas are always worth exploring. We all think he can be more assertive and make sure his ideas are tried and heard! Ask others to explain their thinking, not with the intention of proving them wrong, but to make sure everyone's ideas are considered.

### Playing a Part In the Community

* On Friday, Sept 04, I organized an informal gathering for Turing Students and learned La Bamba for guitar
* I regularly attended most DSA events and completed binary-search trees
* On Wednesday, Sept 09, I attended the viewing of the Internet's Own Boy (documentary about Aaron Schwartz)
* On Friday, Sept 25, I volunteered to help moderate Lightning talks
* On Friday, Oct 02, I will be giving a Lightning Talk about the open source software Audacity


## Goals Moving Forward

In addition to learning and applying new skills, I plan on taking part community events going forward, including:

* Giving Lightning Talks
* Creating a (Good) personal website
* Helping Organize Community Events
* Attending Developer Meet-ups
