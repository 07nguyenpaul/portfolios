> Mike is not only a talented programmer but is also an effective and valuable collaborator.
> He stepped into leadership roles when necessary but was always a positive contributor to the group as a whole. While it is easy for those who are ahead to either intentionally or unintentionally leave others behind, Mike was always careful to keep everyone in the group on the same page and to provide guidance to teammates when necessary. I would be happy to work with him again any time. - Tyler Graham
