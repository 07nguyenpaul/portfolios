### Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing with limited programming experience (from some independent study and an introductory Java class in college), and one of the main objectives I had was to correct some of the things I feel went wrong in the past. First, I wanted to force myself to fully understand concepts when seeking help from more experienced programmers, instead of just going along with what they are saying; second, I wanted to dig into the basics of Ruby and comprehend every item of code I was adding.

### End of Module Assessment

**Assessed by**: Jhun

**Notes**
* Ruby syntax, style, use of blocks and enumerations, workflow, and collaboration all on level expected for end of module 1.
* The testing is your weakness. You know how to write tests, but the testing is not driving your development enough. Work on TDD.
* You were very nervous, and that seemed to affect your performance. Take a breath. You are doing fine. I think of you as a strong developer.

**Scores**
* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3
