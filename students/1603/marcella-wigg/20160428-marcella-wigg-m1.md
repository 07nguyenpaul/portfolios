### Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing with limited programming experience (from some independent study and an introductory Java class in college), and one of the main objectives I had was to correct some of the things I feel went wrong in the past. First, I wanted to force myself to fully understand concepts when seeking help from more experienced programmers, instead of just going along with what they are saying; second, I wanted to dig into the basics of Ruby and comprehend every item of code I was adding.

### End of Module Assessment

**Assessed by**: Jhun

**Notes**
* Ruby syntax, style, use of blocks and enumerations, workflow, and collaboration all on level expected for end of module 1.
* The testing is your weakness. You know how to write tests, but the testing is not driving your development enough. Work on TDD.
* You were very nervous, and that seemed to affect your performance. Take a breath. You are doing fine. I think of you as a strong developer.

**Scores**
* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 3
* Workflow: 3
* Collaboration: 3

### Work

(Intro)

#### Mastermind
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcellawigg/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)
**Assessed by** Mike

**Comments**
* Be careful to send more messages and depend on ivars less.
* Pull messages printed to screen out to different class or maybe module.
* Clean Ruby overall for this point in module.
* Frustrated because REPL had been working, but I attempted an extension and broke in process.

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

### 3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 2: Application's REPL has inconsistencies and/or there are errors in base gameplay

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.

#### Recommendations

**Comments**
* Good TDD, but go get some help understanding the concept if it's slowing you down
* Get help earlier. Working for two days and not understanding without help is not healthy
* Get code working first, and then work on refactoring. It looks like you spent more time refactoring working things instead of making new things work
* Concepts are coming together, but you're missing out on completion

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marcellawigg/sorting-suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

**Assessed by** Lovisa

**Comments**
* Code is mostly clean, though could be refactored into shorter methods in a few places.
* Testing thorough enough. Tested for each method.
* Tests need better, more consistent names, as they are not currently consistently clear as to what they are doing.

### Functional Expectations

3: All three sort classes work as expected

### Testing

3: Tests cover functionality and demonstrate some escalation of complexity across the examples.

### Ruby Style

3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.

### Organization

4: Version control maintains the codebase

**Comments**
* Improved testing syntax from previous time. More consistent
* Could have more full test coverage.
* Use of enumerators decent; usually chose right one, but there were a few places where you could have chosen better.
* Good breakdown into logical components.

### 1. Functional Expectations

3: Application fulfills all base expectations

### 2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

**Comments** (in evaluation).

### 1. Overall Functionality
* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

**Echo/Foxtrot Note:** Requirements listed are for *Foxtrot* pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* First group to use a module. I liked that. Code was pretty clean. Some portions had pieces and parts to look at and work on but with what they had i think they were okay.


### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.
* little to no test.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
* For the most part their code had single lined methods and had single responsibility. I feel if they had more time things could of been a little tider but I do like the implementation of the classes.
