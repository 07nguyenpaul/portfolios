### Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing with limited programming experience (from some independent study and an introductory Java class in college), and one of the main objectives I had was to correct some of the things I feel went wrong in the past. First, I wanted to force myself to fully understand concepts when seeking help from more experienced programmers, instead of just going along with what they are saying; second, I wanted to dig into the basics of Ruby and comprehend every item of code I was adding.
