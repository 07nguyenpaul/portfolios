### Areas of Emphasis

There is a page in my notebook dated 3/21/16 (my first day at Turing) where I list three main bullet points as my areas of emphasis for module one.  The first two sounded difficult at the time but I now make me laugh inside at the fact that they were once legitimate goals.  Number one, I wanted "to become more comfortable with programming lingo".  Ultimately I wanted to be able to increase my ability to express problems when asking for help as well as effectively communicate solutions if I found myself offering help to someone else.  Second on my list was to be able to explain to my girlfriend, parents, friends, etc. what object-oriented programming is.  I can comfortably say that I have accomplished both of these goals.  I have had countless conversations over the past six weeks that have required me to use proper programming lingo in order to discuss problems.  In regards to explaining OOP, I tried explaining to my girlfriend, Ashlynn, how everything revolves around objects, methods, and states and am confident that she was able to at least understand the basic underlying concepts.  I consider that a win.  My final goal was to cultivate a more "creative-thinker" attitude with the hopes of being able to approach the same problems in a variety of different ways.  To me, this was the most important.  One of my main flaws coming into Turing was my tendency to figure out a solution to a problem that worked and just go with it.  Programming has taught me that your first solution is rarely the best or most efficient despite the fact that it may work.  The general concepts of refactoring and pairing have helped me greatly in my approach to problems all throughout my life.  

### End of Module Assessment

- Assessed By: Mike
- Challenge: Recipes
- Notes:
  * Had to be reminded to write tests first, but once reminded wrote good,thorough tests.
  * Couple of syntax hiccups, but great problem solving skills. Understands hashes and data structures.
 
#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API
* 4: Developer is able to write Ruby with a minimum of reference or debugging

#### 2. Completion and Progress
* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing
* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow
* 4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

#### 5. Collaboration
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

### 6. Enumerable & Collections
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
