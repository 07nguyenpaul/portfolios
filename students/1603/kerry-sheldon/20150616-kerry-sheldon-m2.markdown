# Kerry Sheldon - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
I had the following goals for the module:

**Technical**: understanding the Model-View-Controller framework, remaining current on Ruby fundamentals, improving my CSS skills.  

**Other**:  seek opportunities to get help and provide help to others; find the right opportunities to provide leadership, contribute to Pahlka posse.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kjs222/robot_world)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/crud_sinatra.markdown)

Created a Sinatra app that contains a directory of robots with full CRUD functionality.  Dashboard shows statistical data on the robot inventory.  Chart JS used to display statistics in charts.  JQuery used to make chart display interactive.

#### Mini Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kjs222/refugee_donations)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

Created a rails app that communicated donation needs for arriving refugees.


## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Rush Hour(Partners: Brian and Parker)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ExCaelum/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Receives data over HTTP from a simulation engine. The application parses and stores that data. Site shows client's data about their website traffic through a HTML interface.

###Needs update

 Evaluation Comments (Jhun): I liked the implementation of the project. There were a few long methods but that is to be expected with what was happening. One thing I liked was that variables were clear and I could see what was going on. I liked their test. I encouraged them to make sure to test edge cases.

 Evaluation scores:
 * Functional Expectations: 4
 * Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3.5
 * Test Driven Development: 4
 * Breaking Logic Into Components: 4

Feedback to me (from Anna):
I enjoyed working with Kerry on HTTP.  I thought we worked well together, and I liked our approach of completing most of the work together, taking turns driving. Kerry is a very strong programmer. There were times when it would have been faster for her to just take over, and I really appreciate that she didn’t. Specific strengths I observed and learned from: writing/refactoring into concise methods, descriptive method names, and testing in general. Beyond the project, I see Kerry as a strong contributor to the Turing community. Many mod 1 students approach her for help; she is always patient and helpful.


#### Little Shop (Partner: Karina and Robbie)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/robbiejaeger/little_shop)
* [Heroku App](https://refugeerestore.herokuapp.com/)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)


A system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business.

Extension provided analytics for an individual merchant, allowing a merchant to compare themselves to various peer groups.  Analytics were represented with polar charts using ERB, Javascript and ChartJS.

Evaluation comments: (paraphrased from eval) Great that we held ourselves to a high standard on testing, etc and developed our own extension.  Good use of modules where appropriate.  

Evaluation Scores (Jhun):
* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 4
* Enumerable & Collections: 4
* Code Sanitation: 4



Feedback to me (from Colin): Kerry was an amazing partner for Black Thursday. Her organization, and foresight made what could have been quite a stressful project, beyond manageable. Working with Kerry was fantastic. I learned so much from her in ways to set myself up better for future projects, and assignments. Kerry and I did do a DTR, where she was very communicative and open about how she’d like projects to go, and never once did any problems arise. It was true privilege working with her and seeing her skills with Javascript and how they culminated in our Black Thursday project. Much like she said, we both might need work in preventing typos, but I can’t knock her on that since I too am very guilty of some mistyped keys, but truly can’t think of anything else for criticism. Thanks Kerry!

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* I completed every weekly survey for both SAB and staff purposes
* I sought opportunities to let classmates know when they did something well.  
* I tried to provide meaningful feedback to classmates during peer review sessions.

### Being a Community Member

* I attended every day this module and sought to be an active and engaged participant in GearUp discussions.
* I tried to take advantage of opportunities to learn and develop, including participating in a available pairing sessions.


### Playing a Part

* I presented our hackathon project at the hackathon showcase.
* I attended every posse meeting this module and sought opportunities to contribute despite limited technical skills.
* Feedback from posse (Beth Sebian):  "In the 6 weeks I've had a chance to work with Kerry in Pahlka posse, her strengths as emerging software developer have been evident. She is professional, engaged, and intentional in her contributions to our group. It's clear she is already a strong programmer, but I've found it especially impressive that she so tactfully uses these skills to advance the overall learning of our group. These soft skills, combined with what I expect will soon be some pretty badass software ninja skills, will make her a force to be reckoned with by the time she graduates Turing. I'm thrilled she's interested in working in the social justice/civic tech space and would be delighted to have a chance to work with her again."
