### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement more than one solution in Ruby through refactoring

### 3. Rails Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to smoothly utilize Rails methods and structures with a minimum of debugging or support

### 4. MVC & Rails Style

###### Marcella Wigg
Marcella, I have enjoyed and am sure I will continue to enjoy working with you. Your ability to google and implement features based upon searches is an amazing skill you definitely excel at. One thing I would suggest you work on is gitwork flow. You know the right things to do such as checking out branches, but you could git better (ha, get it?) at remembering the basic commands such as git checkout, git branch, git fetch, and being more mindful of which branch you’re on at a given time. I have already seen this improve so I’m not too worried about it. Your work ethic and dedication is also on point! You keep to your word and are always an effective team member.

###### Robbie Jaeger
Robbie, you incredibly intelligent and thoughtful. You are diligent about understanding and problem solving because of that, you have a great coding process. In addition, you are also able to talk through your process when prompted or blank looks are given (thank you for adapting to my non-verbal cues). Sometimes I think you’re a little slower to action and you mull things over a bit too long. I’m never against thinking about things but I think at there should be a balance between throwing shit at the screen(which is what I do) and thinking about it for just a little too long and slowing down progress a bit. I look forward to working with you more and hope to learn patience and critical thinking from you.

###### Ben Peppers
Ben, I truly believe you just need a tiny bit more time and more confidence in yourself, and your abilities. The way you “do what you need to do”, so matter-of-factly is astounding. Remember you chose this, staying at Turing, rather than just leaving which does show determination and dedication, because you don’t need to do this. But you want to. You have always been willing to ask for help, which is an astoundingly rare quality. You are able to implement things while simply talking about concepts which proves understanding, and I believe you can do anything you put your mind to. You’re an incredibly kind person, and able to put in the work necessary to succeed. I believe you’re going to do great things, and the extra mod will give you the time to gain the confidence you need to succeed. I know you’ll kick ass next mod. Keep optimistic.

###### Marcella Wigg
Your help on Git workflow has been very valuable! Thank you for your patience with me. You might consider working on your attention to detail, since you mentioned you have misunderstood aspects of the spec due to not closely reading enough. But otherwise you've been a very positive (and funny!) teammate.

###### Robbie Jaeger
Jenny is great to work with. She keeps the atmosphere in the group light by joking with everyone. Jenny can sometime get off track and lose focus on the task at hand, but it hasn’t been a big problem. One thing I’ve learned from her is a bias toward action. She always wants to just try something and throw a pry in, which can move things forward when problem solving becomes stagnant.

###### Kris Sparks
Jenny is a rockstar when it comes to support and encouragement. She meets with me weekly for pairing and tutoring and works to ensure I have the support and resources I need. Our tutoring time is invaluable. She checks in on me regularly in-between meetings. I wouldn’t have made it this far without her support.

###### Ben Peppers
Jenny’s enthusiasm is unmatched.  She was the first person I paired with in Turing for help on Flashcards and she was amazing.  She may not always have the answer but is more then willing to talk things through with me, try a few things and help me come to a conclusion that works.  Jenny definitely knows whats she's doing and her positivity is very much welcomed when I was freaking out about projects or Turing in general.  She is a great person to know at Turing and I have no doubt she will represent the best of what Turing is when she graduates.

### Playing a Part

This module I paired with module one students by signing up on the 1603-1605 pairing schedule for four weeks. I also had a regular pairing session with one module one student every Wednesday.
I also organized a board game night. I enjoyed it so much that I made a slack channel! Join boardgamenight for gaming on Friday evening.
