# Lucy Fox  - M2 Portfolio
*********ADD COMMUNITY STUFF, EVAL FOR LITTLE SHOP, FEEDBACK FROM MARCELLA

### Areas of Emphasis
  My goal beginning mod 2 was to come out feeling comfortable to work through complex problems quickly and independently and to improve my git flow. I feel confident six weeks later being able to say I've accomplished these. I've been able to work through many tutorials and projects successfully. During group projects this mod I've been comfortably developing a more sustainable and realistic git workflow which I hope will continue to improve as I go.

## Work
All the things.

### Team Projects:
### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/icorson3/rush-hour-skeleton
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md

Rush hour felt like blind typing that somehow managed to produce results. Struggling through this project certainly made me more comfortable with active record. It also made me realize Active Record is a bottomless pit of helpful methods that I need to continue exploring in mod 3.

(Evaluation Comments)
Notes:

* In the response data: The response times should be unique.
* The controller could be broken up into smaller components. We also have nested conditionals which says that we could restructure that section.
* Some logic is in the controller that could be pulled out.
* To make a robust test helper, we could do all the payload creation before bringing it to the test.
* We are hard-coding the client id as well, which doesn't cause issues at the moment but could. Create the client when creating the payload and pass the actual client id in, not just the integer 1. This shows we are not using active record to its fullest potential.
* By creating the entire payload outside of the test is less expensive than creating it in every test. We should also create and analyze the raw payload in the test helper before the test.
* The test helper could also have a default payload and if we want to change specific attributes, we could pass them in instead of creating specific payloads for specific instances.
* In our payload request test, we asserted that the count of the payloads was zero in tests that it was unnecessary in. Since we have tested that the payload can be created, there is no need to test the count of the payloads until after the data has been saved to the database.
* What we called the Payload Analyzer may be described in a better way because it doesn't analyze the data but "handles" it. Could rethink some variable and method names as well.
* Work to understand active record relationships and how you can call clients' payloads in a direct way.
* Feature testing was missing for user can see all events.
* Feature testing could be more specific by testing certain html elements on the page. There might be an overlap where the same phrase appears in more than one place on the page so be as specific as possible.
* We checked the validity of our tables by creating an instance and we could have just made an instance that we didn't save.
* The tests were robust and tested edge cases but included too much information. Be careful about how many instances are created and why they are necessary.
* To get a 4 on testing, we needed to have our event feature test and some of our data would need to be restructured.
* Our accessors in some of the classes are not being utilized.
* There were instances that we hard-coded the first position in the array ([0]) and there are active record methods such as find_by that would allow us to access that position without hard-coding.
* We could have utilized partial views for some of our views such as all the index which could be interpolated.
* We could capitalize our html in a method and pass it to our views instead of directly in the views.
* Work flow was good but we could have used the comments more throughout the project when merging.

(Evaluation Scores)
####1. Functional Expectations
3: Application fulfills base expectations

####2. Test-Driven Development
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

####3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

####4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

####5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic
3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

####6. View Layer
3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

Workflow (NOT GRADED)
3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.


### Little Shop - Socks And Found

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/lucyfox4131/socks_and_found
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown

Little shop has been one of the most exciting and entertaining projects I've done at turing. Not only was I incredibly lucky to work with Marcella and Charlie, but I was also lucky enough to get to stare at goofy socks while we created our project. However, it has made me realize I definitely can up my CSS/HTML game.

## Individual Projects/Non-Evaluated Projects

### Sinatra CRUD

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/lucyfox4131/robot_world
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/crud_sinatra.markdown

  I appreciated that our introduction to the web came with Sinatra, rather than just starting out in rails. I felt like I really appreciated each individual piece of CRUD development during the project, and it was really exciting to use robot world to understand the basics of CRUD. I liked being able to use this project to develop my knowledge of the testing environment. It was exciting for the first time to be able to put it all together and create a "real" website!

### Tool Chest

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/lucyfox4131/tool_chest
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/forms_and_route_helpers_in_rails.markdown

  I wish I had put more time into tool chest than I did as I felt it had a lot to offer. While it was helpful, I didn't spend as much time focusing on the authorization and authentication pieces in tool chest. I think spending more time on this would've been helpful going into some of the later projects.

### Mix Master

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/lucyfox4131/mix_master
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/tree/master/ruby_02-web_applications_with_ruby/mix_master

  Mix master was a lot of fun! This project was a good amount of repetition that definitely helped with some of the more basic skills necessary to succeed during the mini project and during little shop. The Oauth stuff felt like a big jump from the rest of the project though, and I still feel like I'm not super comfortable with Oauth. I look forward to getting more practice with it.

### Rails Mini-Project

* [GitHub URL] https://github.com/lucyfox4131/wellness_challenge
* [Original Assignment] https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown

  For my rails mini project I attempted to build an app to handle the Turing weekly wellness challenge. I was surprised at the challenge this became. What I struggled most with was the idea of implementing a calendar and being able to "schedule" your goals so that each week you could reuse goals you had already created. I ran out of time during the weekend to totally implement this feature like I wanted so I spent extension time working with the simple calendar gem to create a calendar and schedule goals and luckily...finally got it to work! One thing I plan on during intermission week is taking some time to beef this project up a little more.  

### Peer Feedback

##### From Ilana:
* Lucy has been an awesome team member. The background and knowledge Lucy brings to the group have helped push the group forward in the logic pieces. Lucy might benefit from taking the time to remember that not everyone is as badass as she is. When things get frustrating, Lucy can show her frustration but she has been very open about that. All in all, Lucy is pretty great.
* Lucy has been really helpful this module, both emotionally and conceptually. I appreciate that she is constantly asking if others need help. Her knowledge base is very strong and she understands the logic pieces quicker than most. She also regularly contributes to group retros and tries to keep the cohort connected.

##### From Erin:
* Lucy is a sharp programmer and excels at clearly seeing the logic of the problem at hand. She has been great in getting our group moving and digging into bugs when they come up. As an improvement, Lucy could work on slowing down to more clearly communicate her ideas before implementing them at times.

##### From Marcella:
*  


##### From Charlie:
*  Working with Lucy on Little Shop has been a pleasure.  I really admire her general work ethic and drive.  She has been instrumental in keeping things moving on a day to day basis. Our group has had an easy time working together which I really appreciate. Two week projects are a lot of work and it meant a lot to me to have two group mates who were so dedicated to turning in a good product while also maintaining respect and good relations with their partners. I think sometimes it was tough for Lucy to not move forward at a quicker pace which may have caused some frustration. It can be tough to move at a slower pace than you are typically used to and I think she was great about catching herself wanting to move ahead and respecting our pace. I was able to learn a lot from Lucy thanks to her extensive knowledge and willingness to put in time to help explain things. I think we turned in a great project and I look forward to working with Lucy in the future.
