### Areas of Emphasis
(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
After completing M1, I was well aware that I was not the strongest student in
the 1507 cohort. I am somwehat bothered by this and I spent the entire
intermission week studying. I was especially happy that the material introduced 
was *NEW* and exciting!

I was very determined to do well in this module. I figured that I might not be
the strongest rubyist, but I could work really hard on Rails and do well. After all,
no one really had experience with Rails!

So, in short, my biggest area of emphasis was to learn Rails. I wanted to incredible at Rails!

(description)
Perhaps the most frustrating week of Module 2. This is where I realized that I
am not a huge fan of group projects. I do not feel that I learn as much and I
to compete with certain personality types. This should not be confused as being incompatible
with classmates. I thorougly enjoyed my team mates. I became frustrated as I am fairly
that things like team dynamics seemed to take away from learning opporunities.

Other than that, I enjoyed the project.I think it's a great spring board for Rails.

A great project! Loved the flexibilty to branch out and try new technologies, integrations,
and tasks. For me, this project was a good confidence booster and I finally started
to feel like I might actually be learning Rails!

I feel like this project wasthe first actual project with complex team dynamics,
work-flow, tasks, and expectations.
