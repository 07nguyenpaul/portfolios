#Adam Jensen - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

I started Turing with self-practice and study focused on Javascript. This mostly consisted of online tutorials and begging approachable devs to teach me. I am happy to say that I have finally stepped outside of browser IDEs and am now working in Ruby. I started with *zero* Ruby skills knowledge on July 6, 2015. I have since completed the following projects and fully understand all work that was submitted. A main goal of mine was to make sure that I only included code that I was able to understand. I was able to use self-management skills to make the most of the past 6 weeks 'keep up' with the curriculum.

### Areas of Emphasis

My primary goal entering M1 was to learn Ruby and TDD. In the last 6 weeks, I feel like I have adequately learned the following Ruby fundamentals:

* Strings and Integers
* Arrays
* Hashes
* Enumerables
* Object-Oriented-Design basics
* Call Stacks, Scopes, execution control
* the Ruby Object Model

I also worked on soft skills such as:

* Pairing
* Communication
* Approaching problems with systematic logic

In this project I built a Markdown Parser. This was great fun and I thought it was a good learning lesson.

Eval comments
Program runs.
No extensions
Chisel class has no methods, just code.
Some mixing of logic.
HTML output has extraneous brackets and new lines.

Eval scores
