#Adam Jensen - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

I started Turing with self-practice and study focused on Javascript. This mostly consisted of online tutorials and begging approachable devs to teach me. I am happy to say that I have finally stepped outside of browser IDEs and am now working in Ruby. I started with *zero* Ruby skills knowledge on July 6, 2015. I have since completed the following projects and fully understand all work that was submitted. A main goal of mine was to make sure that I only included code that I was able to understand. I was able to use self-management skills to make the most of the past 6 weeks 'keep up' with the curriculum.

### Areas of Emphasis

My primary goal entering M1 was to learn Ruby and TDD. In the last 6 weeks, I feel like I have adequately learned the following Ruby fundamentals:

* Strings and Integers
* Arrays
* Hashes
* Enumerables
* Object-Oriented-Design basics
* Call Stacks, Scopes, execution control
* the Ruby Object Model

I also worked on soft skills such as:

* Pairing
* Communication
* Approaching problems with systematic logic

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Attendance

I did not miss any time during Module 1. There were no tardy or absent occurrences.

### Work

I completed the following projects this module:

### Projects

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamki/linked-lists)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/data_structures_and_algorithms/tree/master/linked_lists)

Still, in my opinion, the hardest project of my Turing experience so far. However, quickyl realized that also the most important lesson to learn so far.

* Struggled early, but later parts made more sense without help
* Good tests needs some edge case work
* Good functionality
* Some spots for better refactoring/encapsulation

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping / Recursion: 3

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/adamki/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/chisel.markdown)

In this project I built a Markdown Parser. This was great fun and I thought it was a good learning lesson.

* Program runs.
* No extensions
* Chisel class has no methods, just code.
* Some mixing of logic.
* HTML output has extraneous brackets and new lines.


* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 2.5
* Breaking Logic into Components:3

## Team

####  Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/NicoleHall/Enigma-Project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Good project. Loved using Enigma as a springboard to learning how classes/objects connect. I also learned that pairing is hard.

Does encrypting, decrypting, cracking in under 1 second
Does not print the correct key
Watch whitespace
Tests don't pass

* Functionality:3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Final Assessement

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:

* Good command of editor and terminal.
* Wrote tests first.
* Has a good instinct on starting small with tests and on what to test.
* Ran tests at very small intervals, to check progress
* Reached for #select, to filter words.
* Good communication skills, with laying out train of thought.

Scores:

* Ruby Syntax & API: 3
* Ruby Style: 3
* Blocks & Enumerations: 3
* Testing: 4
* Workflow: 4
* Collaboration: 4
