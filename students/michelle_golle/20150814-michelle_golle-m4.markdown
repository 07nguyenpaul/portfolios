# Michelle Golle - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt weak on JavaScript. I used Exercism three times
per week, read the "Eloquent JavaScript" book, and tried to apply these concepts
in my individual and team projects. In the end I feel much more comfortable with
JavaScript.

### End of Module Assessment



### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of a 1/2 day
absence on Friday, July 24th.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Revenge of Idea Box

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellegolle/idea_box)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/4fdd6da8e2e431beeb77012e271de1eee90d5e07/source/projects/revenge_of_idea_box.markdown)

In this 4-day-long project I built an idea box that used jquery and JavaScript to
add, update, and delete ideas without refreshing the whole page. It was evaluated by Tess:

"I loved how organized the JS is based on what we've learned so far."
"Maybe just try to work on some additional features."

* Features: 2.5
* UI: 3
* Testing: 3
* Rails Style: 4
* Ruby Style: 4
* JavaScript Style: 3

#### Scale Up

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellegolle/scale-up)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/JumpstartLab/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/the_scale_up.markdown)

In this seven-day project I took a pivoted project, added a large amount of seed data to the data base, and improved its performace. It was evaluated by Horace with the following results:

"Good improvements based on a small amount of changes so far, would love to see how much better it can get with some caching etc"

* Deployed to Heroku: Y
* Uses Newrelic: Y
* What is the average performance and traffic? 2
* Required number of records seeded? Y
* Load Testing Script 2
* Performance Optimization Techniques 2
* Additional Features 3


## Team

### Projects
I participated in the following team projects:

#### Game Time: Duck Hunt

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/michellegolle/duck-hunt)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

In this 7-day-long project We built a recreation of the classic duck hunt game. This was a pure JavaScript project. It was evaluated by Jeff:

"Game is decently playable. Some unpredictability of the speed unless you refresh.
You can shoot ducks
Used Canvas for moving the duck around
15 tests that all pass
Decided to improve code rather than build more features
JS implementation looks pretty clean
Look for opportunities to push functionality out of your "god object" into the children -- out from index.js into other files."

Functional Expectations: 3
Test-Driven Development: 3
Breaking Logic Into Components: 3
Fundamental JS and Style: 3
Code Sanitation: 4
