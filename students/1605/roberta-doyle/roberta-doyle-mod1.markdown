### Work

(Intro)

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roscalabrin/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

(description)

Mike's Notes:

* two large classes
* Program fully functional, although there was some confusion as to how the cheat functionality worked.
* There are the beginnings of organization, remember to pull out code that belongs together to their own separate classes.
* Saw that classes took arguments and return values a lot - great keep it up
* Think about how you would pull out any text printed out to the screen into its own class or a module for organizational purposes.

Fundamental Ruby & Style                3
* Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

Enumerable & Collections                3
* Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

REPL Interface and Game Functionality   3
* Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

Breaking Logic into Components          3
* Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.

#### Jungle Beat

Mike's Notes:

* 24 test
* Make sure tests are small and don't involve other methods
* Generally good code, very well split up.
* Some methods are longer, and could use better names.

Functional Expectations                         4
* Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

Test-Driven Development                         3
* Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components  4
* Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

Fundamental Ruby & Style                        3
* Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Looping or Recursion                            3
* Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

Horace's Notes:

* Lot of progress and seems like some good learning came out of all of it
* Game gets through most of the gameplay but has some trouble finishing out the sequence when the player wins
* A few categories of improvements we might make stand out:
* Looked at taking sequences of methods that get used in a linear process and isolating them from one another so that i could use JUST step 1 if i wanted to in isolation
* Talked about focusing on return values of methods and how this improves testability of the project
* Also keep looking out for opportunities to take a handful of individual but similar values / variables / etc and put them into 1 collection (rather than storing row_a, row_b, etc)
* Obviously using enumerable methods effectively will be the key to this
* Several of the objects are still a bit large, especially from the perspective of how many instance variables we are storing -- when we start to see this, need to ask if we can make multiple different objects out of the big one

Functional Ruby & Style          3
* Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Enumerable & Collections         2
* Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques

Test-Driven Development          2
* Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

REPL Interface                   2
* Application's REPL has some inconsistencies or rough edges

Breaking Logic into Components   3
* Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

Feedback from Ryan Flach
Roberta was the perfect teammate. She possesses technical strength to solve most problems, but, more importantly, she is persistent and positive when we encounter a problem that we aren’t immediately able to solve. She doesn’t allow herself to become too entangled on a single issue and acknowledges when it is time to move onto a different approach. She is able to talk through and explain her reasoning, and she shares in all responsibilities to achieve a good working balance and eliminate any ill feelings from one partner doing too much or too little. She would be a strong asset on any team.
