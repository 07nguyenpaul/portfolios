Mike's Notes:

* two large classes
* Program fully functional, although there was some confusion as to how the cheat functionality worked.
* There are the beginnings of organization, remember to pull out code that belongs together to their own separate classes.
* Saw that classes took arguments and return values a lot - great keep it up
* Think about how you would pull out any text printed out to the screen into its own class or a module for organizational purposes.

Fundamental Ruby & Style                3
* Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

Enumerable & Collections                3
* Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

REPL Interface and Game Functionality   3
* Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use and application fulfills base expectations from the project spec

Breaking Logic into Components          3
* Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.

#### Jungle Beat

Mike's Notes:

* 24 test
* Make sure tests are small and dont involve other methods
* Generally good code, very well split up.
* Some methods are longer, and could use better names.

Functional Expectations                         4
* Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

Test-Driven Development                         3
* Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components  4
* Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

Fundamental Ruby & Style                        3
* Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Looping or Recursion                            3
* Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
