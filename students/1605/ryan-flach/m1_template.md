### Work

(Intro)

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ryanflach/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

_Description:_
Recreation of the classic game Mastermind. A user attempts to guess a randomized secret code of anywhere from 4-8 characters, built from 4-6 colors, depending on difficulty level chosen by the user. Upon successfully guessing the secret code, the user's number of guesses and time taken is printed to the terminal, and the user is invited to play again or quit.

_Evaluation Comments:_
* good breakdown of responsibiliies in to disparate clases
* really liked class methods in Communication class, though would like to have seen more messages printed out to the screen in there for consistency and organization's sake.
* Some opportunities to refactor for clarity.
* Methods on the whole were nicely short.
* Think more about how you can rewrite your methods so that they take arguments and return values rather that modifying an instance variable.
* Remember that instance variables shouldn't change often.

_Evaluation Scores:_
_Funamental Ruby & Style_
* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
_Enumerable & Collections_
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections
_REPL Interface & Game Functionality_
* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions
_Breaking Logic into Components_
* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ryanflach/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

_Description:_
Jungle Beats explores linked lists via the creation and use of a number of methods that might typically be found on arrays. This version contains a user interface that allows the user to add to and reset their 'beat', as well as change the voice and speed.

_Evaluation Comments:_
* 50 tests
* Look closer at what youre testing, check for ways you can change code that breaks the intent of the program but still allows tests to pass.
* JB has a REPL
* Used both recursive and iterative approaches.
* Try to use some better method names, and you dont have to go all the way refactoring small things, clarity is king.

_Evaluation Scores:_
_Functional Expectations_
* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension
_Test-Driven Development_
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
_Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components_
* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
_Fundamental Ruby & Style_
* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
_Looping *or* Recursion_
* 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques
