# Ryan Flach - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I came to Turing with a limited-but-functional understanding of some OOP principles and Ruby syntax. I aimed to become more proficient in the command-line and expand the scope of my understanding in both OOP and Ruby, allowing me to write small-scale, complete programs of my own, and to understand code that included principles and code that I don't yet have experience with. I also aimed to use and understand the fundamentals of TDD. Additionally, it was important to me to become involved in the Turing community.

### Work

(Intro)

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ryanflach/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

**Description:**<br>
Recreation of the classic game Mastermind. A user attempts to guess a randomized secret code of anywhere from 4-8 characters, built from 4-6 colors, depending on difficulty level chosen by the user. Upon successfully guessing the secret code, the user's number of guesses and time taken is printed to the terminal, and the user is invited to play again or quit.

**Evaluation Comments:**<br>
* good breakdown of responsibiliies in to disparate clases
* really liked class methods in Communication class, though would like to have seen more messages printed out to the screen in there for consistency and organization's sake.
* Some opportunities to refactor for clarity.
* Methods on the whole were nicely short.
* Think more about how you can rewrite your methods so that they take arguments and return values rather that modifying an instance variable.
* Remember that instance variables shouldn't change often.

**Evaluation Scores:**<br>
_Funamental Ruby & Style_<br>
**4**: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring<br><br>
_Enumerable & Collections_<br>
**3**: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections<br><br>
_REPL Interface & Game Functionality_<br>
**4**: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions<br><br>
_Breaking Logic into Components_<br>
**3**: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.<br>

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ryanflach/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

**Description:**<br>
Jungle Beats explores linked lists via the creation and use of a number of methods that might typically be found on arrays. This version contains a user interface that allows the user to add to and reset their 'beat', as well as change the voice and speed.

**Evaluation Comments:**<br>
* 50 tests
* Look closer at what youre testing, check for ways you can change code that breaks the intent of the program but still allows tests to pass.
* JB has a REPL
* Used both recursive and iterative approaches.
* Try to use some better method names, and you dont have to go all the way refactoring small things, clarity is king.

**Evaluation Scores:**<br>
_Functional Expectations_<br>
**4**: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension<br><br>
_Test-Driven Development_<br>
**3**: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality<br><br>
_Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components_<br>
**4**: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility<br><br>
_Fundamental Ruby & Style_<br>
**4**: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring<br><br>
_Looping *or* Recursion_<br>
**4**: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ryanflach/sorting_suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

**Description:**<br>
Sorting Suite explored three main computer science sorting algorithms: bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort. This version of the project includes a benchmarking extension and both inplace and swapping methods for insertion sort.

**Evaluation Comments:**<br>

## Community

### Giving Feedback
* "Raphael has a systematic approach to solving problems that ensures he is capturing the scope of the project and approaching each element thoroughly and with purpose. He breaks things down into smaller, manageable pieces and tests each. This enables him to explain each step well and repurpose methods. It was a pleasure working with him!" - Feedback given to Raphael Barbo

### Being a Community Member
* "I had the pleasure to pair with Ryan during one of our in-class assignments, and I can certainly say that he is a very diligent   and quick to jump into the problem and come up with creative ways to resolve it. Definitely looking forward to some more pairings in the future." - Raphael Barbo
