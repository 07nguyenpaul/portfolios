# Tommasina Miller - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis
 This module, I want to immerse myself in learning as much as I can about Ruby and OOP. Though I've had limited experience working with Ruby prior to starting at Turing, I am confident that I can learn the fundamentals and grow tremendously in my skills and knowledge. I can only go up from here!

 I'm excited about the opportunities for mastery in this immersive program, and I have done my best to set up my life to revolve around becoming the best programmer I can. I want to learn the breadth of the field but the depth of learning I will experience at Turing is what excited me about this program. I am anticipating this experience being extremely difficult but the empowerment I feel from these new skills will be a worthwhile reward.

### Work

I've had the opportunity to work on three personal projects this module: Mastermind, Flashcards, and NightWriter.


* 1) Flashcard

* Assignment Spec (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

* Completed Project Repo: https://github.com/chompasina/flashcard

* Flashcard Evaluation (https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/flashcards/tommasina_miller.markdown)
Assessed By: Horace


Notes:

      Looking solid with Ruby fundamentals and basic OOP mechanics
      Seem comfortable defining classes, methods, working with ivars, interacting between multiple classes
      testing is looking good -- seem to have main concepts down and be executing on them -- keep an eye on edge cases and making sure we test each scenario with a few different inputs
      Round class was quite concise and well-implemented; talked about a few ways to possibly make it even simpler by avoiding tracking duplicative information in multiple instance variables
      Doing this will make the code a little leaner and also give us better paths to testing some of this logic

  Scores:
  1. Functional Expectations

      3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

  2. Test-Driven Development

      3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

  3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

      3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

  4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

      3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

  5. Enumerable & Collections

      3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

* 2) NightWriter

* Assignment Spec (https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

* Completed Project Repo: https://github.com/chompasina/night_writer

* NightWriter Evaluation (https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1605/night-writer/tommasina-miller.markdown)

Assessed By: Jhun

Repo: https://github.com/chompasina/night_writer

  Notes: - glimpse of SRP implementation not completely there - Tests communicated to me that developer was there logically but tests were failing - Test where cascading in complexity which I liked - application could not convert from braille

Scores:
1. Overall Functionality

    1.5: Application only converts to Braille or from Braille

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development

    2: Minor mutations to the implementation code, such as swaping characters, changing < to <=, placing true into a conditional, or deleting a line of code which break the functionality do not cause any tests to fail.

4. Breaking Logic into Components

    3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities


## Team

I've worked on two projects with partners in my cohort: HTTP- Yeah You Know Me and Headcount.

Assessed By: Mike

Repo: http://github.com/caleb9193/http-project

Notes:

    16 tests
    Faraday tests were not implemented
    Some opportunities to refactor were present, things like complex conditionals pulling messages out to a separate place
    Some methods/classes doing a bit too much
    really liked the runner pulled out

1. Overall Functionality

    3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

    3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development

    1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

4. Breaking Logic into Components

    3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

## Mid-Module Assessment

Assessed By: Jhun

Challenge: Player Tracking

Notes: - Developer is really close but didn't implement solutions as confidently as I'd like to see - Developer is a soft 3 in ruby syntax & api but I would like to see that be a solid 3 - Developer was a great collaborator

Ruby Syntax & API

2.5: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

Ruby Style

3: Developer writes code that is easy to follow

Blocks & Enumerations

3: Developer demonstrates understanding of blocks and can effectively use enumerable methods

Testing

3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

Workflow

3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

Collaboration

4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Although Kris had already finished his work, he stayed and helped me with my Flashcards project until late in the night when I finally finished. He asked me questions to get me thinking about the next steps and was patient with my learning process.

Caleb was a great partner during our HTTP project. Though neither one of us had built a server before, we worked through it together step-by-step. He made connections with code faster than I did, but he made sure to explain his thought process so I could keep up.

Raphael often stays late working on projects and will periodically check in with me to make sure I'm doing well. He'll stop to work with me if he's ahead, a kindness which does not go unappreciated.

Matt has helped me get through 4 or 5 iterations of various projects in module 1. He breaks down problems into simple pieces and is able to reiterate these problems in different ways until I understand. He can even do this with problems he hasn't even reached himself yet!

During one difficult moment before a project due date, Trent gave me a pep talk that helped me get through my block. He also spent hours re-working a project with me so that I was keeping up. His jokes and sense of humor have lightened many work hours for me.

Sonia reached out to me during a difficult week and invited me for coffee, a sweet gesture which I really appreciated. She gave me some insights on working through code and shared from her experience, making my situation feel less dire.

Roberta cheered me up during a low moment by appreciating something about myself that I hadn't noticed. Her perceptiveness and peaceful demeanor make her a programmer to be admired and a friend to be cherished.
