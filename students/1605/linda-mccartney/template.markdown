### Notes:

* user input for deck implemented
* good tests, one missing piece for testing the current card
* talked about using attr_reader methods instead of directly accessing @thing

###Scores:

##### 1. Functional Expectations

#### 3.5 (implemented user input for card deck)

4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality as well as two extensions.

##### 2. Test-Driven Development

#### 3.5

4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

##### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

#### 3.5

4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

## Team

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](Evaluation)
* [https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/67df787e17e66bb446af2e10c4c6e72b3d41579b/source/projects/night_writer.markdown](NightWriter)

The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon's army so soldiers could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing led to Louis Braille's development of his Braille tactile writing system.

In this project we'll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from normal characters and the reverse.
