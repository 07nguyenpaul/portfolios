## Mission Statement
Coming into Turing I expected to be challenged, but that's the reason I chose this school.
### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)

I hadn't done much programming before Turing, but prior to coming in I feel that I had enough tools
to be able to keep myself from completely struggling. Therefore my goal this Module was to show enough
progress so that I wouldn't be forced to repeat Module 1. The first week I struggled heavily with command queries
and mythical creatures, and the idea of classes and objects didn't quite click after the first week.
However I was able to really put in extra time over the first weekend, which allowed me to feel
confident and prepared for our first project.

(description)
The first project seemed very daunting at first, however I had done enough of the command query and mythical
creatures exercises to really excel through the first three iterations. This allowed me enough time to focus on one of
the more difficult (at least at the time it seemed) extension where I was able to write a dynamic text file. Unfortunately
I spent so much time trying to generate a text file that looked neat and provided a pleasant user experience that I
neglected the style aspect. After the project I began to understand the importance of keeping your classes simple and purpose
driven. I'm still learning about when to assign an attribute vs creating an entirely new method for an object's purpose.

Notes:
Assessed by: Horace

- solid project demonstrating competency with fundamental ruby concepts and mechanics of OOP
- looked a couple small ruby style points around boolean expressions; talked about consistently re-using method logic that has                 already been implemented
- like seeing the enums you are using (lots of map, even a little zipping going on)
- going forward, bigger stylistic points we talked about involved avoid tracking unnecessary data in instance variables and
  looking for opportunities to extract new classes with specific responsibilities wherever the opportunity arises
- testing is looking good, but would like to see more of it

(evaluation scores)

1. Functional Expectations
  4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality as well as two extensions.

2. Test-Driven Development
  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

5. Enumerable & Collections
  4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

### Playing a Part

 1. I try to help my cohort by trying to help them and point them in the right direction, especially in areas they are struggling with. I try to be a voice in my cohort and step up when we need volunteers for different things.
