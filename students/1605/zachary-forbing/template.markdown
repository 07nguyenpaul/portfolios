### Areas of Emphasis

Before I got to Turing, I set out to "learn how to learn." I've tried learning languages on my own in the past - small amounts of javascript, html & css - but I wasn't able to really speak the language, let alone write poetry with it. that was how I described the learning process in the midst of the module, as learning a second language, and simultaneously having my ability to write poetry in it be scrutinized.
After getting here, however, I realized I needed to learn less generalized practices. TDD, DRY, TRUE, SRP have all been driving factors in my projects, even if I didn't end up having enough time to implement them fully. These principles continue to drive my coding behavior, and learning the way I have at Turing, that's not going to change anytime soon.
