### Areas of Emphasis

Before I got to Turing, I set out to "learn how to learn." I've tried learning languages on my own in the past - small amounts of javascript, html & css - but I wasn't able to really speak the language, let alone write poetry with it. that was how I described the learning process in the midst of the module, as learning a second language, and simultaneously having my ability to write poetry in it be scrutinized.
After getting here, however, I realized I needed to learn less generalized practices. TDD, DRY, TRUE, SRP have all been driving factors in my projects, even if I didn't end up having enough time to implement them fully. These principles continue to drive my coding behavior, and learning the way I have at Turing, that's not going to change anytime soon.

### End of Module Assessment

Challenge: What Can I Make

Notes:

* In a good spot overall; comfortable with the fundamentals -- making classes, methods, objects,
working with ivars, etc
* Generally able to pick the right choice for a data structure or method; if we picked something weird
we realize it quickly and correct
* Still forgetting ends here and there and having minor syntax trip ups
* main area for improvement would be continuing to get a little quicker at synthesizing the multiple steps
required to put together a more complex process -- e.g. taking a process we had outlined for a single thing
and applying it to a collection of those things

Scores:

1. Ruby Syntax & API
  3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

2. Completion and Progress
  3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

3. Testing
  3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

4. Workflow
  3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

5. Collaboration
  3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

6. Enumerable & Collections
  3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

Notes:

Overall solid project making good use of ruby fundamentals, demonstrating comfort and proficiency defining classes, defining methods, tracking and updating instance variables, etc
did good job managing the I/O throughout the program
Enum capabilities seem to be coming along
OOP structure is coming along, just still showing fairly large concentration of the program's overall logic into 1 dominant class, talked about ways to start looking for that pattern and identify additional classes or methods that can be pulled out to share some of this responsibilty.
Scores:

1. Functional Expectations
  3: Application fulfills expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality.

2. Test-Driven Development
  3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality.

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP.

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

5. Enumerable & Collections
  3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

Repo: https://github.com/zackforbing/nightwriter

Notes:

He started thinking about immutability using constants in his tests.
He used inheritance to share functionality among classes.
Created a support folder to store the text files that he was using in his tests.
Overall, I think he has the right instincts and good handling of abstractions. With a bit of guidance, he'll do really well. I think he'll enjoy reading POODR.
Scores:

1. Overall Functionality
  2: Application converts to Braille and back successfully

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development
  4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

4. Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

Feedback from Ben:
Zack is incredibly positive and realistic to work with. It was a pleasure working with him.  I think we were able to play off each other well during HTTPYYKM.  Near the end of the project Zack was very confident in his skills and was able to explain what was going on to me when I was lost. He understands ruby quite well and I have the utmost confidence that Zack will continue to be a fantastic member of the Turing Community.

Notes:

1. Overall Functionality
  3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development
  2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

4. Breaking Logic into Components
  3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
