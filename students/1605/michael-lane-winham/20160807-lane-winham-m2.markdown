### Areas of Emphasis

I set out to strengthen my technical skills during module 2. I want to do this by working until I feel comfortable with the material the first time around, not repeating. I would also like to start going to community meet-ups and expand my knowledge of the the community outside of the dungeon. In addition to learning rails I want to continue to work on my foundation in ruby and use this six weeks to get as strong as I can.
