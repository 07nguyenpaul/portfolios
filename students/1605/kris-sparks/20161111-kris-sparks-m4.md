# Kris Sparks - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goal for Module 4 is to learn JavaScript, reinforce the fundamentals and concepts that I have learned throughout my time at Turing and to begin focusing on the job search. I plan to dedicate the first three weeks purely to academics, learning JavaScript through Idea Box and Game Time. During week 4 I plan to shift my focus  by attending meet-ups, job events, and reaching out to contacts in the community.

## B: Individual Work & Projects


#### SCALE UP

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/LookingForMe/lookingForFrontEnd)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/week-4-kickoff.markdown)

During Scale Up I worked on the Turing legacy project lookingFor. The project has a Rails backend and a React front end. My goal was to gain as much exposure to React as possible over the two week period. I attended the React classes and completed a tutorial in which I built a Todo List app. Once I was more familiar with React I was able to resolve several issues that we inherited from the previous cohort. I also implemented a new feature that allows a user to flag a mark as 'favorite'. In the end I learned a lot about React and met my original goal. I would have liked to have a little more of a structured plan from the beginning and learned more in the first few days.

### Work

####  GAME TIME

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/kbs5280/game-time)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_04-apis_and_scalability/gametime_project.markdown)

UFO is a single-player, 2D collision-detection game built using JavaScript and an HTML5 canvas. It was a great learning experience because we were immersed in JavaScript. Matt Packer and I worked well together and used great project management and Git workflow. In the end we built a great game and learned a lot. Given more time/experience we would have refactored more and extracted more logic from the game.js file, which in the end had too much code and multiple responsibilities.

### E: Feedback and Community Participation

To Zack:
"Working with Zack is always a positive experience. Of all the things that stand out, the thing that stands out the most to me is his willingness to take on any problem. He is always willing to dig in and find a solution regardless of the issue. We both need to continue to work on time-boxing our work and managing our time efficiently. Zack’s commitment to learning and working hard is notable and will serve him well in whatever is next."

To Matt:
"I really enjoyed working on Game Time with Kris. He demonstrated enormous commitment, drive, and problem solving capabilities throughout each iteration of the project. I valued how he would walk me through his thought process, demonstrate his theory in code, and respond intelligently to suggestions.  Kris has a talent for breaking complicated problems down to approachable steps. This helped us progress as a team and ultimately deliver a project that we were both proud of. I think Kris may benefit from periodic reflection on progress made. I think by taking a step back from the problem at hand and visualizing what has been accomplished, he can continue to progress successfully. I think he is tremendously talented and a strong problem solver, so this reflection will provide him with more confidence to handle the next challenge. I truly believe that Kris will be a valuable asset to any company that he decides to join."


### Giving Feedback

From Zack:
"Kris was a great team lead during ScaleUp. We had the opportunity to pair together on building out the Favorite Jobs functionality, and pairing with Kris is always a pleasure. Kris is great at communicating what he is thinking, and listens very carefully when you are explaining something or talking through ideas on how to implement something. Even more, Kris is an absolute workhorse on his own. He really puts in the hours and does what it takes. I'm glad I got another opportunity to work with Kris, and I know that he won't have a problem in his new career."

From Matt:
"Working with Matt on Game Time was a great experience. Matt is patient and a great collaborator. He works systematically and strategically. His commitment to project management and Git workflow is excellent. He approaches problems at the most basic level and then works to solve the problem. Matt is willing to try new approaches. He works to find out solutions when it’s challenging and frustrating, without getting frustrated himself. He is hard working and is committed to learning, and that will serve him well in his next endeavor.”

### Playing a Part

During my time at Turing I have made an effort to participate in as many opportunities as possible. Additionally, I tried to be conscientious of anything that I could do to help. I cleaned up the kitchen and did the dishes. I rearrange tables and chairs and offer to help when I can. I try and reach out to other students for academic and emotional support.
