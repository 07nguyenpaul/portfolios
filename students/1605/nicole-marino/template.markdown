Scores: 

Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

REPL Interface and Game Functionality

4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.


#### JungleBeats:

Origin assignment:https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/tree/master/source/projects/jungle_beat
Description: Linked Lists 


Notes:

21 tests - raises an error during test as intended.
next time, place tests in a test directory, and code files in a lib directory.
Write more descriptive test names
each class should have its own file where the name of the file matches the class
good iterative implementation in looping methods
Remember that you can get all of your getter methods for free with attr_reader
Lean more on your debugging tools instead of puts driven development.
good way to develop good style - check out http://houndci.com or rubocop

Scores:

Functional Expectations

3: Application fulfills all base expectations

Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Looping or Recursion

3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
