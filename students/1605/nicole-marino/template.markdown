---------------

## Mastermind:

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/Mastermind
Original Assignment:https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown
Description: Create a working mastermind game. 

No comments

###Scores: 

Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

Enumerable & Collections

3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

REPL Interface and Game Functionality

4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.

---------------

## JungleBeats:

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/JungleBeats
Origin assignment:https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/tree/master/source/projects/jungle_beat
Description: Linked Lists 


Notes:

21 tests - raises an error during test as intended.
next time, place tests in a test directory, and code files in a lib directory.
Write more descriptive test names
each class should have its own file where the name of the file matches the class
good iterative implementation in looping methods
Remember that you can get all of your getter methods for free with attr_reader
Lean more on your debugging tools instead of puts driven development.
good way to develop good style - check out http://houndci.com or rubocop

###Scores:

Functional Expectations

3: Application fulfills all base expectations

Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

Looping or Recursion

3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

---------------

## SortingSuite

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/SortingSuite
Origin assignment:https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/tree/master/source/projects/jungle_beat
Description: Sorting Algorithms 

Notes:
Had to fix path to get tests to run.
9 tests, all passing
did in place insertion in lieu of insertion

###Scores:

Functional Expectations

3: All three sort classes work as expected

Testing

4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

Ruby Style

3: Code is a readable and effective implementation of the algorithm. Has fewer than 4 "what on earth is this?" lines of code.


Organization

3: Each sorter class has it's own file in the proper directory and it's own test in the test directory

---------------
## Battleship

Repo: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/Battleship
Origin assignment:https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/tree/master/source/projects/jungle_beat
Description: Battleship gameplay. 

###Scores:

1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
2. Enumerable & Collections

2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
3. Test-Driven Development

1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
4. REPL Interface

3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use
5. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

---------------

## HTTP-YYKM

* [GitHub URL]: https://github.com/NicoleKMarino/HTTP-YYKM
* [Original Assignment]()
Notes:
diagnostic data works
/hello increments counter -- make sure only for this path
datetime and shutdown both work
iter 3 word search works
I4 & I5 working
when initializing an object, don't have any other side effects; use a method for that


###Scores:

Overall Functionality
3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4
Echo/Foxtrot Note: Requirements listed are for Foxtrot pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5


Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.


Test-Driven Development
3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.


Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
