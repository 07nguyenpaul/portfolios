### Areas of Emphasis

During this module, I hoped to really grasp object oriented programming, logic, and Ruby. I wanted to learn the importance of Test Driven Development and how it can lead you to write code that is easily readable and practical. Honestly, at the beginning of the module, I didn't know what I didn't know, so my main goal was to just soak up everything that I could. As the module went on, my goals became more specific. Some of those goals were to strive to have code that is DRY, continually ask myself if I am applying SRP, thoroughly understand Objects and their attributes, and get better at spotting opportunities for meaningful refactoring. Having these things on my radar was a huge help during my projects. I am amazed at how much I have learned and accomplished this mod! Things that seemed impossible in the beginning seem so attainable now.

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Work

I completed the following projects this module:

#### Flashcards

* [GithHub URL](https://github.com/allindow/projects/tree/master/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

This project was a flashcard program that is used through the command line. A user is able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round. I completed extensions which allowed the user to load a txt file of "cards" from the command line and provided them with a new txt file of their guesses, correct answers, and score.

**Feedback from Brenna**
* 28 Assertions
* Use of pause function was sweet!

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation/Breaking Logic into Components: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumberable & Collections: 4


#### Night Writer

* [GithHub URL](https://github.com/allindow/projects/tree/master/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

This project translated latin characters to Braille-like text and vice versa. It was a great project to get comfortable with manipulating and accessing elements in an array with Enumerables.

**Feedback from Jhun**
* soft 3s for tdd and breaking logic into components. - could look at creating the brailer converter into 2 classes (eng - braille) (braille - eng) - a lot of loops but adhearing to the speck she passes


* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Drive Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

## Team

### Projects

Working in a pair, I completed the following projects this module:

#### (Project Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/allindow/http-project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

We built a functioning server that responded to Get and Post requests via Postman. Get requests could be made to check the date/time, a counter, and took a parameter for a word search. Post requests could be used to play a number guessing game which redirected to a page that gave you feedback on your guess.

**Feedback from Mike**
* All functionality works
* 35 tests
* Generally good tests, make sure you test for different        cases, and for possible edge cases.
* Generally well written code, there are some opportunities to refactor complex conditionals and longer conditional branches.
* Opportunity to refactor messages out into a module, look at how you can reduce reliance on instance variables

* Overall Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Drive Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

### Feedback to Me

**From Yoseph Anderson**: Angela is a dependable partner that displays a strong hunger for problem solving. She has strong determination facing setbacks, and works well under pressure. During the project, she was able to drive and keep a strong and steady pace to not fall behind on finishing the project and hit the ground running. She displayed well developed organization skills.

### Feedback from Me

**Yoseph Anderson**: Yoseph is a fun, energetic, and efficient partner to have on a project. He keeps things light-hearted and also has a good eye for opportunities for refactoring. He was able to contribute equally while driving or while talking while I drove. He was able to keep a good momentum going during times when I was feeling stuck.

## Community

### Playing a Part

* I looked up everything I could find about Turing when I was considering attending, so I have been tweeting about my time at Turing with the #turingschool for anyone who, like me, wondered what the student experience was like.
* During projects, I often take breaks to walk around and check in with my peers and see how they are doing and talk about anything they may be stuck on. When anyone has a question, I do my best to research the issue and ask them questions or provide suggestions that could help them come to the answer they are looking for. I am looking forward to helping the next new cohort, as well.
* I have brought my stepson to Kids Who Code and am looking forward to assisting George and Heidi when it starts up again!

## DTR Memo
  These are notes from Tommasina and my DTR meeting before we began Headcount.

-Learning goals for the project: T wants to sticking with TDD, even when we don't know what we're looking for, A too; A's goal getting comfortable with parsing through CSV
-Collaboration styles: divide and conquering, one person do merge and pull requests,
-Communication preferences: Angela is comfortable with anything, slack, last projects used screenhero, talked on the phone
-Work style: T likes to work slowly and methodically, have to understand. Angela is about efficiency, doesn't have a lot of time to not be efficient, thinks about it when doing other things,
-Last project: worked well: worked efficiently with Y, they weren't at Turing as much as others, but still got work done. split up when a concept that neither one knew what was going on, which helped (but not necessary for that project), what went poorly: time sucks with a concept that we weren't taught about and took a long time to figure out, tried to figure out why headers weren't working, frustrating to spend so much time on one problem -For best work: needs clarity about what's going on, when we're working, what we're working on,
-Scheduling restraints- T wants to be in bed by 10, A can't stay every late every day, but could stay up to 6 every day except Thursday, could screenhero around 7:30 and could be available most of the night,
- read through all files, CSV files, sketch an idea out of how classes are working, to feel like I understand the spec

-Schedule: tomorrow plan on staying until 6 and then Wednesday, we have to see, Thursday screenhero 7:30, Saturday the rest of the day could work, Sunday could do screenhero in late afternoon,

-What holds you back from feedback? A can give feedback no problem, T nervous about holding us up,
-What are your strengths? A good at implementing ideas, can figure out a way to do it, good googler, T motivated

-What could use improvement? T wants to be more confident at coding, keeping our current goal in mind, A to encourage her to say it aloud; for A, she wants to remember to keep things to a single responsibility, to help, T could use triple checker attitude to remind us to refactor into multiple methods
- We'll try using trello to manage our responsibilities
