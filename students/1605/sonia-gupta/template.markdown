### Areas of Emphasis
My goal in repeating this module was to make the best use of the knowledge I acquired last time so that I could advance to the next module with a solid understanding of OOP and algorithmic thinking. Although I have experienced some struggles, I believe I have achieved my goal. I have significant room for improvement, but I have established productive habits which will facilitate the expansion of my skill set. Most important, however, is that I am starting to develop a passion for programming. For me, passion comes after discipline, and the rigors of this module have instilled in me a dedication to the craft that I did not anticipate. I believe that with further practice, and continued discipline, I will be able to successfully advance through the program.

Challenge: What can I Make

Notes:

* PASS
* Doing well on fundamentals --working with ruby syntax, writing tests, defining objects and methods, etc
* Overall workflow and understanding is pretty comfortable
* Biggest spot for improvement continues to be a) recognizing what is required by a problem statement and b)
picking the right tool out of toolbox to do that

Scores:

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

#### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Work

I successfully completed all four of the required projects this module. I also spent considerable time on my own working through drills and exercises on my own and in pairs.

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

This project involved building a command line flashcards game which accepted guesses from the user and compared those guesses to the correct answers on the cards.

Notes:

clean and straightforward project structure
demonstrating really solid ruby fundamentals and mechanics -- seems like you're much more comfortable now with defining classes, defining methods, working instance variables, and tracing the interactions between a handful of classes
especially like the amount and variety of the tests -- seems like you are giving a lot of attention to thinking about different scenarios, trying out different inputs, etc etc
looked at a couple small style points -- avoiding unnecessarily verbose boolean expressions and not forgetting about methods you already wrote such that you end up reimplementing the same code in another place
finally talked about using small I/O / display helper methods to help break up the structure of a large I/O-intensive loop

1. Functional Expectations: 3

2. Test-Driven Development:4

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

4. Enumerable & Collections: 5

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/nightwriter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

This project involved building an English-to-Braille and Braille-to-English converter.

Notes:

23 tests, 27 assertions, all pass
test that file actually reads
Good clean code, great use of some advanced enumerables such as Group_by with with_index
Methods well separated.
try to avoid instance variables to hold things that arent about a things state.

1. Overall Functionality: 3

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

3. Test-Driven Development: 3

4. Breaking Logic into Components: 4

## Team

### Projects

I worked on two paired projects this module: HTTP and Headcount. My partners in both projects were exceptional, and I learned an incredible amount from them. I did find some aspects of pairing to be challenging, but I believe that the experiences pushed me to grow as an individual and as a programmer.

#### HTTP

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/tgisg/httpyykm)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

This project involved building an HTTP server which accepted client requests, parsed them, and then sent the appropriate response back to the client.

Repo: http://github.com/matthewecampbell/httpyykm

Notes:

30 tests
Well separated code
some opportunities to refactor, look at complex conditionals and inside conditional branches
well tested, make sure that you're testing multiple cases in the future

1. Overall Functionality: 3

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

3. Test-Driven Development: 3

4. Breaking Logic into Components: 4

### Giving Feedback

To Kris Sparks: I have had a chance to get to know Kris over the course of the last two modules. His work ethic, drive, and commitment to the task are remarkable. He is frequently among the first to arrive at school, and among the last to leave. I have witnessed him overcome struggles that he previously thought insurmountable, and am inspired by his willingness to expand his comfort zone. He has taught me about patience, kindness, and putting your nose to the grindstone when the task needs to get done. He does not complain, and he often checks in with me, and with others, to see how things are going. He is an asset to the Turing community and I am excited to see what he will accomplish in the future.

To Kerry Sheldon: Kerry has been incredibly supportive this module. She developed the student support system for Pahlka posse, and I have been lucky enough to have her as a mentor in this capacity. Working with Kerry is always such a delight. She has skillfully guided me to my own conclusions rather than foisting answers upon me. Her patience and expertise have allowed me to develop my own skills, and I am lucky to have had the opportunity to learn from her. She has taught me a lot about myself as a person and as a programmer. Her commitment to Pahlka posse, and to the greater good, is remarkable. Her leadership will help us to grow and I’m excited to see what she comes up with next module!





### Being a Community Member

From Kerry Sheldon: I had the opportunity to work with Sonia throughout this module and remain impressed by Sonia’s work ethic and resolve.  I really enjoyed seeing her experience success and acknowledge the progress that she has made over the past few months. I’ve been impressed by Sonia’s discipline to work on drills and exercises in pairing sessions, rather than projects.  She is a disciplined pseudocoder and resourceful problem solver.

Sonia will be the first to acknowledge that her confidence in her programming skills can be tenuous at times. I’d like to see Sonia fake some more confidence in her skills, for her own benefit, and the benefit of her programming.  I think it’s important for Sonia to give herself opportunities for routine, regular wins and to provide herself with a way to objectively see her  progress.

I’m  grateful for Sonia’s commitment to the Pahlka posse throughout the module, in spite of her personal doubts about her ability to contribute.  Her attendance and involvement served as an example to other Module 1 students in the cohort.  Sonia is a natural leader and her presence lends credibility to the rest of us.
