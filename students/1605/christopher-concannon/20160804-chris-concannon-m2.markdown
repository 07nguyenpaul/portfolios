# CHRIS CONCANNON - MODULE 2 PORTFOLIO
****

### Individual Areas of Emphasis

At the end of Module 2, I want to be comfortable with all of the course material covered, including using user authentication, building web frameworks with Rails, being comfortable writing tests which cover all my bases for running servers, and any "extra" learning opportunities with JavaScript or other languages for html markup. I would also like to have a published blog which has entries of not only my personal weekend adventures, but also entries which might help others learn about complex (or trivial, but unfamiliar) topics that I have learned in my time at Turing.
