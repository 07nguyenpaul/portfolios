# CHRIS CONCANNON - MODULE 2 PORTFOLIO
****

### Individual Areas of Emphasis

At the end of Module 2, I want to be comfortable with all of the course material covered, including using user authentication, building web frameworks with Rails, being comfortable writing tests which cover all my bases for running servers, and any "extra" learning opportunities with JavaScript or other languages for html markup. I would also like to have a published blog which has entries of not only my personal weekend adventures, but also entries which might help others learn about complex (or trivial, but unfamiliar) topics that I have learned in my time at Turing.

Assessed by: Andrew

Notes:
* I need to focus on using tests to drive actions when coding. I get ahead of myself and jump 3-4 steps ahead implementing controller methods before I even have actions created which point to the methods. I got lost implementing view logic because I wasn't relying on my test error messages or expectations enough. 
* Ruby syntax/styling is ok... could refactor conditional branches a bit
* I could be more effective in using collaboration - I'm good at announcing my thought processes and speaking to what I'm coding while I do it, but I could benefit from consulting my pairing partner more. 

#### Scores:

Subjective evaluation will be made on your work/process according to the following criteria:

#### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

* 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

#### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

#### 3. Rails Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to utilize Rails methods and structures, but needs some direct guidance

#### 4. Rails Style

* 3: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

#### 5. Testing

* 2.5: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development
* 2.5: Developer struggles to use tests to drive development

#### 6. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

## Graded Group Projects

I completed all projects assigned to our cohort, with scores of four 3's and two 4's. I was an integral member of each of my teams. 

## Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/concach/rush_hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

My project partners and I created a website which would allow a user to view various analytics for websites. These included data such as site traffic, response times, most popular referring sites, etc. for both root paths and other specific paths within a given domain. This was my first project involving user authorization and JSON parsing. 

#### Scores

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* almost 4!
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer

* 4: Application breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.

## Little Shop of Orders

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/roscalibrin/alicorn_adoption)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

My group and I made an e-commerce site using Ruby on Rails. The site allowed visitors to register for an account, and then sponsor various mythical creatures. There was a full-featured "cart" which the users could fill with creatures of their choice, then check out. Orders were saved in the database. Past orders could be viewed for a logged-in user. Admin functionality was built in to add additional creatures to the website. Admins were also allowed additional site privileges. 

## Ungraded Assignments

Most of the Module 2 work time was spent on ungraded projects that repeated and reinforced ideas which we had learned in class. Takeaways from these projects are listed below. 

## Sinatra CRUD

Sinatra CRUD served to fixate the CRUD operations in our minds. I learned the RESTful routes and what each looked like in terms of the HTTP verb, path, and controller action. This was critical before being introduced to Rails. 

## Tool Chest

Tool Chest provided much-needed practice in creating database migrations and implementing user authorization and authentication. This was our first in-depth use of sessions to track things across multiple page loads within a browser. 

## Mix Master

Mix Master was a very long, thorough tutorial which provided a basis to learn database relations. One-to-one and one-to-many data relationships were successfully established, then used to access database items for objects which did not exist in the same tables. This was the first project in which I thoroughly made use of ActiveRecord methods to access relational attributes. 

## Rails Mini Project

I decided to try to build a blogging platform for my Rails mini project. I did not end up finishing the project to a point that I feel comfortable sharing it with the world, but I did learn a lot. I implemented the ability to create an account, log in, create a post, and tag that post with categories. I also created the ability for visitors to view all user posts and comment on those posts (although, this functionality never worked flawlessly). The entire construction was done with TDD. This was a good exercise before heading into our Little Shop final project because it gave me confidence in my TDD abilities.

### Feedback Received

#### from Matt, re: Rush Hour
* Working with Chris was a great experience.  I certainly learned a lot of technical skills while working together on Rush Hour and he was always patient to take the time to teach them when necessary.  He was also very easy to work with and open to suggestions from anyone in the group.  Because of these qualities, the project when very smoothly.  We were also able to finish the base functionality quite quickly.  I would definitely love to partner up with Chris again in the future.

#### from Yoseph, re: Rush Hour
* Throughout the project, I noticed that you are really a really good leader driving the group into a direction. It saves time from pondering about where we could ‘possibly’ go and accomplish some amount of work. The only constructive feedback I could give is to offer more support towards team members, such their ideas or if they’re not understanding things. You did an amazing job contributing, leading the group at the start of the project, and helped me grasp new concepts! Your determination shines!

## Feedback Given

#### to Matt, re: Rush Hour
* Working together was a pleasure, thanks! I honestly have no “negative” feedback to give. I feel like you kept the energy level of the group up (consistently more than Yoseph and I did) while we were all working together. Communication was great. Definitely don’t be shy about telling the group when you’ve worked on an issue for an hour or three. I hope we get to work together again.

#### to Yoseph, re: Rush Hour
* I appreciate your work ethic - I think you’re willing to contribute more time to a group project than most people at Turing. The only constructive feedback I have is that it seems like you get distracted easily and stray from the task that we had been working on as a group. However, your contributions were all very much appreciated and I think you were the best “driver” of the group when we were doing paired programming. You did a great job with the portions of our project which you undertook on your own. Thanks!

## Playing a Part
I paired with mod 1 students a total of three times and I gave remote advice through Slack to a mod 1 student (about Battleship) several times over a weekend.

I prepared and gave a lightning talk on "Big O Notation". I actively participated in all Gear Ups and Student-Led Sessions (I joined the Interview Prep sessions). 

I continued to be a part of the small, but growing, Turing running community by leading Thursday track workouts, and participating in Friday lunch runs. 

I began the module as part of the Clojure-learning posse. However, I only made it as far as the first two weeks' curriculum. I plan to continue learning Clojure over the intermission break and weekends when I do not have projects. The posse experience has taught me how self-sufficient I have become when trying to learn something new. I am very confident that I can learn a new language or framework with a few days of practice and free online sources for exercises.
