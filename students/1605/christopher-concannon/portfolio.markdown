# (Chris Concannon) - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for Module 1 was to successfully complete all the projects and maintain a good work-life balance that I can sustain throughout my tenure at Turing. Going back to school, especially a conceptually difficult technical school with very high commitment expectations, is a huge lifestyle change. I wanted to develop strong relationships with Turing students and learn as much as possible from my peers as well as the instructors.

Assessed by Rachel. Verbal comments: Good effort toward refactoring, but methods are still too long and could use more refactoring. The game runs well with no errors. This is a good effort toward the first project.

Scores:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

### 3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2.5

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.
* 2: Application makes use of some methods, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

#### (Jungle Beat)

(description)

Notes:
* 23 tests, all passing.
* Did some recursion as well, remember to not use instance variables with recursion, anything you need to maintain state of you should pass as an argument.
* Good testing, make sure you are testing both sad paths, and making sure that any "hard" code in your implementation will let your small tests pass.

Scores:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques
