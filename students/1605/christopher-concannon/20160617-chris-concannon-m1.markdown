# (Chris Concannon) - Module 1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goal for Module 1 was to successfully complete all the projects and maintain a good work-life balance that I can sustain throughout my tenure at Turing. Going back to school, especially a conceptually difficult technical school with very high commitment expectations, is a huge lifestyle change. I wanted to develop strong relationships with Turing students and learn as much as possible from my peers as well as the instructors.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed By: Horace

Challenge: Shopping List

Notes:

* Very comfortable over all; biggest thing is we are doing well at quickly digesting the shape of the problem and
seeing how to turn that into an implementation
* Comfortable writing tests, defining new classes, methods, working with internal state, and manipulating
collections with enumerables
* Very competent and able to deliver results quickly and effectively; handful of smaller style things here and there
that we can continue to polish

Scores:

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 4: Developer fully completes baseline assignment and one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 3: Developer writes tests that are effective validation of functionality, but don't drive the design

#### 4. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

#### 5. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

#### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

### Work

#### Projects

I completed all projects assigned to the Echo group, as well as the two paired projects in the last three weeks of the module. I received only two marks below satisfactory levels (scores of "2.5" and "2"), on Mastermind and Battleship. I corrected my deficiencies on projects that followed. I received many 4's, including a score of all 4's on the Sorting Suite project.

#### (Mastermind)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

(description)

Assessed by Rachel. Verbal comments: Good effort toward refactoring, but methods are still too long and could use more refactoring. The game runs well with no errors. This is a good effort toward the first project.

Scores:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques and collections

### 3. REPL Interface and Game Functionality

* 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations and application includes one or more extensions

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2.5

* 3: Application consistently breaks concepts into logical methods to encapsulate functionality.
* 2: Application makes use of some methods, but the divisions or encapsulation are unclear.

#### (Jungle Beat)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/concach/jungle_beat.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

(description)

Notes:
* 23 tests, all passing.
* Did some recursion as well, remember to not use instance variables with recursion, anything you need to maintain state of you should pass as an argument.
* Good testing, make sure you are testing both sad paths, and making sure that any "hard" code in your implementation will let your small tests pass.

Scores:

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

#### (Sorting Suite)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/concach/sorting_suite.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

(description)

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* 30 tests, all passing
* Did in place insertion sort and selection sort.
* Clean code, look to use methods to pull out complex conditionals.

### Functional Expectations

* 4: All three sort classes work as expected with 2 or more extensions.

### Testing

* 4: Tests are clearly written with names that accurately describe the behavior. Edge cases
such as empty arrays, reversed arrays, etc are also tested.

### Ruby Style

* 4: Any given chunk of code can be understood at a single level of abstraction

### Organization

* 4: Version control maintains the codebase

#### (Battleship)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/concach/battleship.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/battleship.markdown)

(description)

Assessed By: Horace

Notes:

* Managed the complexities of the problem very effectively to produce a game that works smoothly and reliably
* Have a couple of "god" classes that are clearly consuming large chunks of the application logic
* Testing is good at the lower layers of the application tree but falls off significantly at the higher layers
* Talked about how the program probably needs a firmer boundary between any user input and (especially) the Gameplay
class
* If you like this "bottom-up" design approach, an interesting technique could be to focus on pushing the program as far
along as possible using Testing exclusively, then toward the end add in a think User I/O layer that connects to this code
* Testing is the biggest thing I'd like to keep seeing more of in the remaining projects; i think this will also help sort out
some of the "god class" syndrome as well

Scores:

### 1. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 2. Enumerable & Collections

* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

### 4. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

### 5. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage


### Team Projects

#### HTTP: Yeah You Know Me

Assessed By: Rachel

Notes:

diagnostic data works
/hello increments counter -- make sure only for this path
datetime and shutdown both work
iter 3 word search works
I4 & I5 working
when initializing an object, don't have any other side effects; use a method for that
1. Overall Functionality

3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4
Echo/Foxtrot Note: Requirements listed are for Foxtrot pairs -- Echo requirements are shifted by 1 additional iteration -- So a 3 for Echo requires completing Iterations 0-5

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.
3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.
4. Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I actively participated in all group retros and I gave constructive feedback to my peers after pairing exercises and group projects.

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

I organized a group run on Thursday evenings and I participated in the Friday lunch group run. I spent at least 1-2 hours, sometimes more, at Turing after class nearly every day. Sometimes during this time I would work entirely with my peers on items with which they were struggling, and sometimes I would receive help myself. I participated in all Gear Up events and came to all of the Friday morning guest speaker events.

## Review

### Rubric Scores

* **A: End-of-Module Assessment**: 3

Received five 3's and one 4.

* **B: Individual Work & Projects**: 4

Received a total of seven 4's, including all 4's on Mastermind. My deficiencies of 2.5 on "Breaking Logic into Components" for Mastermind, as well as 2 on "Testing" for Battleship have been addressed through focus in those areas on projects that followed.

* **C: Group Work & Projects**: 3

I was a dependable group member for paired projects and I collaborated successfully to meet the project requirements on time, without conflict or need for confrontation from my partners. I believe I am a good project partner because I communicate directly and as often as needed, I have a very critical eye and excellent project planning skills, and I am technically very capable.

* **D: Community Participation**: 3

I believe as a mod 1 student, I fulfilled every expectation of a new member to the Turing community. I helped many of my classmates in-person and on Slack, I voluntarily signed up to pair with mod 2 students on many occasions, I participated in lunchtime fitness activities, and I actively participated in all events of community Fridays. I stay at Turing until 5:30-6pm or later almost daily. I also organize a weekly track workout after school, which has seen interest and participation from other community members.

* **E: Peer & Instructor Feedback**: 4

I am scoring myself a 4 in this category because I try to help my classmates as much as possible and I absolutely never propagate negative energy to the Turing community. I take personal feedback seriously and I am sensitive, yet direct, with others when giving feedback. I actively engage other Turing students to help them when I can, or to help myself as often as needed.
