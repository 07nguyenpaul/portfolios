### Areas of Emphasis

(What did you set out to accomplish this module?)
My goal for Module 1 has been to learn as much as possible and fully immerse myself in Turing and coding.  I had a small amount of programming experience before Turing, and I wanted to see whether coding full-time was something I truly enjoy.  I wanted to push myself to try something challenging and find ways to excel in a challenging environment. I also wanted to establish strong relationships within the Turing community.

### Work

(Intro)

#### Flashcards

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dtinianow/flashcards)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/flashcards.markdown)

In this project, I created a flashcard application that can be used from the command line.  Each flashcard displays a question, takes a guess from the user, and returns feedback about whether or not the guess is correct.  This project includes two extensions.  The first extension allows the user to ask for a hint. The second extension allows the user to generate flashcards by typing the name of a text file either in the program itself or as a command line argument.  This project was implemented using test driven development.

Assessed By: Brenna

Notes:
  - Total Tests: 31
  - Great test coverage
  - Two extensions: Accepting card files and hints
  - Could use more test coverage for sad paths
  - Will check into refactoring big methods

Scores:

###### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all expectations of iterations 1 - 6 with no bugs, crashes, or missing functionality *as well as* two extensions.

###### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data.

###### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility.

###### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

###### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

(Intro)

#### (Night Writer)

* [GitHub URL](http://github.com/dtinianow/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

In Night Writer, I created a program that can transform text into braille and braille into text.  The program reads from a text file, transforms the message, and outputs the transformed message into a new text file.  The program has the capability of including capitalized characters, numbers, and also wraps the message so that each line does not exceed 80 characters.

Assessed By: Mike

Notes:
* All runs, 31 tests, all passing, 54 assertions
* Well written tests, each file of code should have a corresponding file of
tests
* Some repetition in code, some opportunities to refactor.

Scores:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

### Projects

(Intro)

#### (HTTP)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/luigiaversano/http)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

In this project, we created a basic web server.  Our server is able to issue GET requests for pages showing parsed request information, a hello world counter, the date and time, and a page that shuts down the server and displays the total number of requests made.  The server also has functionality to play a guessing game for a number between 0 and 100.  The user makes a guess by issuing a post request.  Finally, the server can issue different responses including 302 redirect, 403 forbidden, 404 not found, and 500 internal error.

Assessed By: Rachel

Notes:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 3.5

* 4: Application implements all five iterations and at least one extension
* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3.5

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

(keep in mind that tests should be indifferent to what has happened in the past -- control your output)

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3.5

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
