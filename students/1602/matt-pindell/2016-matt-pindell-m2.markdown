## Work

### Team Projects

Below is a list of all of my paired projects and assessment scores.

#### Little Shop

Absolutely insane. Very rewarding journey to a functioning CRUD App. First time in a group of four - first time being a team lead - there's still oodles to learn and improve on, but it's cool to see how far we've come in just a few weeks.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Team: Ling Tran, Patrick Hardy, Claudia Kiesenhofer

Assessed By: Andrew Carmer

##### Scores:

* Functional Expectations:
* Test-Driven Development:
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components:
* Fundamental Ruby & Style:
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic:
* View Layer:
* Workflow:

##### Personal Notes:

* Image size consistency
* Semantics on naming "Add to Cart"
* Cart centering
* Margin on Bottom / Footer
* Helpers for views would be nice - we used partials in those cases.
* Before action / application controller methods
* Refactor Commitment Model - currently manipulating Volunteer and Cart within Commitment, sure sign for refactoring. PORO?
* Use Mocks and Stubs
* Use the features RSpec provides!
* `visit` is always a relative path
* Heroku - learn it. Workflow.
* Put Hound in project, make fixes - squash commits into single Hound cleanup commit (in new branch).

#### Rush Hour

Really great intro - glad we got started with Sinatra.

* Design could be improved, but it's adequate.

### Peer-Evaluated Projects

#### Rails Mini Project
* [Github URL](https://github.com/pindell-matt/pointbox)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

##### Feedback on Rails Mini

* __John Bernesser__: "Matt brought a curious and excitable attitude to our peer refactor of the rails mini project. He was eager to learn how I implemented the api as well as Haml and provided great feedback in how I may be able to re-locate that logic outside of the controller. I had a great time walking through my project with him.  Through our pairing I  took with me some awesome suggestions into little shop. Overall I was throughly impressed with his drive to learn, perfectly exemplified by his willingness to hand-roll css."

### Non-Evaluated Projects

## Community

### Golick Posse
* CURL challenges
* DDoS Info
* DevOps Exploration
* Support in learning new low-level languages (Rust)

It's been immensely fun being a part of the Golick Posse - I most enjoyed the CURL challenges Sal and Allan created for us, as it's a far more enjoyable way of learning the basics of curl requests.

Overall, Golick has encouraged me to think more about side skills, the basic logic involved with programming (not beholden to a given language / syntax), and improved my ability to communicate technical concepts.

### Giving Feedback

* __For Claudia Kiesenhofer (1602)__ - "Claudia is always on point, always. Throughout the entirety of Little Shop she was finding ways to improve our project - particularly, I loved how she brought in her past experience as a Volunteer Organizer and bringing in awesome insights to help us improve our UX and make a better final product."

* __For Patrick Hardy (1602)__ - "I was very impressed with how positive, flexible, and productive Patrick was throughout the entirety of Little Shop. While it would’ve been easy to slow down or get discouraged at different points on such a long project with so many voices, he had a constant willingness to not only jump headlong into the next feature - but also troubleshoot the current challenge until it was working just the way we needed. I also discovered how alarmingly self-sufficient he is when tasked with specific responsibilities - and but the end of the project I was relying heavily on his ability to circumnavigate code and march onwards and upwards, totally unprompted. I absolutely feel lucky to have had him on the team."

* __For Josh Washke (1602)__ - "Josh is like a programming steam train that calmly crushes code at a steady, but nigh unstoppable, pace - and it is a great ride to be on. At the onset of Rush Hour, he verbally mapped out what our approach should be, and we proceeded to follow that plan to the 'T'. At every turn, it felt as though he was prepared with the exact proper response to the project's challenges - and was immensely communicative of his rationale and logic throughout each twist / iteration. Working with him was fantastic and helped me to improve both my logic and understanding of the MVC design pattern"

* __For Ling Tran (1602)__ - "During Little Shop, Ling sat me down and provided a breakdown of her 'protips' for working with her - it was hilarious at the time, and showed an impressive level of self-awareness that I certainly don't have. She kept us on track, was constantly positive, and her first instinct was always to listen and absorb before responding - which was a huge asset in a team of four, where things can get hectic quickly."

* __For Deborah Hamel (1602)__ "Deb was an absolute joy to work with on Rush Hour. She kept us excited and on topic throughout the duration of the work, and it was great to watch her grab the reigns of styling! I can only ask for more of that same fire!"

### Being a Community Member

* __From Deborah Hamel (1602)__ - "Matt - Working with you on Rush Hour was a pleasure. You are so smart and tenacious. You are easy to work with and have a stunning work ethic and badass coding skills. I really appreciated your encouragement for me drive during our project. You give Turing a positive, passionate and hilarious heartbeat every single day! You don’t have to be so agreeable all the time."

* __From Ling Tran (1602)__ - "I am impressed by Matt's relationship management skills working with a relatively large project group for nearly two full weeks. He is able to walk the fine line of asserting his opinions while also listening to his teammates - I guess some people would call this the ability to influence. He also has mad googling skills that helped get us over issues when we got really stuck. (Teach me your ways, Matt!) Lastly, through working with him on the Little Shop project, I find myself formatting my own code better because he is unwaveringly disciplined in writing clean and well-organized code. He is also a very fun team member. If Matt were to improve upon something, I might suggest not being as afraid to assert himself. You have nothing to be afraid of dude!"

* __From Patrick Hardy (1602)__ - "It was very nice working with Matt on this project. I appreciated that he took on the role of project manager and effectively managed group-strategy once we got the project rolling. It was also great to have Matt requesting to dive into some of the trickier aspects of the project like integrating paperclip and working with materialize in the styling. Areas for improvement: I think Matt could work on being more systematic when reading stack traces. Slowing the pace down when reading errors etc may help. I really appreciated Matt’s positive attitude and work ethic throughout the project!"

* __From Josh Washke (1602)__ - "Matt! Working on Rush Hour with you was a great experience. You are obviously a strong coder though I disagree with your usage of Vim mode in Atom, even though I know I should probably learn Vim. You also bring a positive attitude to all your interactions that I found both energized, and tampered my frustrations while working on the project. I think coding ability and attitude you bring to any group is summed up well by the success of our rush hour project and I honestly have nothing but good things to say about working with you. I hope we get paired up again next mod."

* __From Claudia Kiesenhofer (1602)__ = "I really enjoyed working on this project together. As the project manager Matt kept us organized on our waffle tasks and made sure everyone knew what to work on next. His ideas to mostly work in pairs and switch those off according to what people wanted to work on made us move very smoothly and made the whole experience so enjoyable.  We had many short check-in on progress to reorganize tasks if necessary and he also did little check-ins which each of us individually. I especially enjoyed how we could all express our different perspectives and come to a good practical middle ground when making decisions . His positive attitude and cheering up quality gave the process a certain lightness and made it even more fun for me. At the same time Matt is very detail oriented and diligent and put in lots of extra hours on styling which made our product look great!"
