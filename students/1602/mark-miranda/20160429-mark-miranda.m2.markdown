# Mark Miranda - M2 Portfolio


## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I want to maintain momentum moving into module 2. I feel like I finished as strong as I planned to in module 1 and do not want to let up. I want to be a bigger part of the community at Turing and attend meetups & other industry-related events and volunteer my time where possible, whether it be helping out module 1 students or taking the opportunity to be a prework guide for the incoming 1605 cohort.

### End of Module Assessment

Assessed by: Rachel



### Mid Module Assessment

Evaluator: Andrew

#### 1. Analytic/Algorithmic Thinking

* 3: Developer breaks complex problems into small, digestible steps and executes them

#### 2. Ruby Syntax & Standard Library

* 3: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby

#### 3. Rails Syntax & API

* 4: Developer is able to smoothly utilize Rails methods and structures with a minimum of debugging or support

#### 4. Rails Style

* 2.5: Developer generally writes clean Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, with some struggles in pushing logic down the stack

#### 5. Testing

* 3: Developer uses tests at multiple layers of abstraction to drive development

#### 6. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

## Evaluated Projects

I completed the following evaluated projects this module:

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/drew-t/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

This was a 7 day project where we built a Sintra w/PostgreSQL application that was used to evaluate payload data. We were evaluated by Andrew with the following results:

Team: Andrew Thompson & Ling Tran & Mark Miranda Evaluator: Andrew github: github.com/drew-t/rush-hour

Notes: Test numbers are decent. Use preferred syntax for hashes. Data prep for testing was overkill, use minimum required data for tests. Add notes on code during PRs. Be explicit on PRs for what you completed.



#### 1. Functional Expectations
  * 3: Application fulfills base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development
  * 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  * 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  * 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic
  * 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.

#### 6. View Layer
  * 3.5: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

## Non-Evaluated Work

#### Rails Mini Project

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/notmarkmiranda/rails-mini-project)

This was a 4 day project that set us up to be in a good place to start Little Shop. I learned a lot based on repetition of concepts we had learned in class, but utilized very little in practice.

#### Robot World

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/notmarkmiranda/robot_world)

This was a 4 day paired project that helped develop our skills working with another person. I paired with Claudia Kiesenhofer. We were evaluated by Mike with the following results:

### Giving Feedback


>**To Drew Thompson:** Charmander has great leadership abilities and helped keep us focused the milestones we needed to hit. He has a great grasp on the concepts as we learn them and the ability to implement them. He also made sure we understood the concepts and the overall picture as well as importance of what we were doing and spending our time. I hope to be paired with Charmander on a project in the future.

>**To Ling Tran:** Bulbasaur is very focused on writing tests and having it drive the development of our code. She's very focused on details without losing focus on the goals to achieve certain functionality. Bulbasaur writes extremely clean and well-formatted code. She's very easy to work with and a great part of any group. She also sings a lot and brings snacks. I hope to be paired with Bulbasaur on a project in the future.

### Feedback to Me

>**From Drew Thompson:** This will be my second time partnering with Charmander on a project. He is a steady partner with a rich inner life. I learned to be braver in exploring options and refactoring in the problem-solving process from him. He was markedly proactive with writing tests, which was something he had been working on since working together on Black Thursday in module 1. The only area for improvement I can identify for Charmander is that sometimes he can get caught up in his thought process and not communicate it immediately with his project partner. This is something I'm flexible with but it might be misleading for a more sensitive project partner. It'll be hilarious if I get paired with Charmander again.

>**From Ling Tran:** Squirtle is very versatile. He is strong in every possible way, in addition to being a fun and compassionate team member. He is tenacious with debugging - using tools to pry into the issue rather than just thinking and talking about possible sources for issues. I learned to be more tenacious in this way by working with Squirtle. The only area of improvement I can identify in working with Squirtle is perhaps being more patient with other people's workflow! Other than that, with an established rapport, I imagine working with Squirtle will be just as awesome again.

### Playing a Part
* I am an active member of the Brin posse. I use weekday mornings before school and some time on weekends working on Ruby problems and exercisms.

* I have weekly screen hero mentor sessions with Travis Yoder. We generally work on refactoring whatever current project I'm working on or work on Exercisms I'm not comfortable with or stuck on.


* I am active in 1602 as a community member as well. I push to help us grow as a group and encourage each other to do well. I have offered to help other students understand concepts that may be unfamiliar. I have also printed stickers for the cohort to help identify and be proud of us as a group, while finding a way to not exclude students who may be repeating.

* I paired with module 1 students weekly to help them through projects, understanding Ruby concepts, and just living at Turing as a whole.
