### Work

This module I completed the following individual work assignments. These assignments were each part of Turing's 'Echo' curriculum, which was described to us as 'jumping into the deep end of the pool.' Timelines felt tight but manageable, and I learned an important lesson: Day 1 is not break time. Get to work! Get going! Get moving! You'll have a much better chance of sleeping the night before a project is due.

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/s-espinosa/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

In this one week project, I built a REPL interface that allowed a user to play the game **Mastermind**. In order to be successful, the game needed to include interactive play that allowed users to guess a string of four colors and receive feedback on whether they had successfully guessed a secret string of colors. Additional basic menu functionality, time tracking, and a "cheat" option were also required.

*Evaluation Comments*
* Fancy game with some difficulty levels
* Pretty solid mechanics and "getting things done" - able to manipulate the language to achieve what you want
* Bigger point is to keep thinking about the structure of our code at a high level and ask whether the way we structure the code matches with the way the problem is conceptually structured


*Evaluation Scores*
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerables & Collections: 3
* REPL Interface & Game Functionality: 4
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 2


####Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/s-espinosa/binary_search_trees)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

Using Test Driven Development, I created classes for four separate sorting algorithms, and an alternative implementation of one of those algorithms. I also created a namespaced Benchmarking class that allowed me to determine which of the sorting algorithms worked the fastest on a given hash. I completed all extensions for this projects.

*Evaluation Comments*
* One thing to consider when refactoring is if you can put restrictions on yourself. How would you do this if you didn't allow yourself to use X method?


*Evaluation Scores*
* Functional Expectations: 4
* Testing: 4
* Ruby Style: 3
* Organization: 4


####Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/s-espinosa/sorting_suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Over the course of 3 days, I created a binary search tree class that had the ability to add new nodes, sort nodes, identify the max/min value, check to see if values were included, report on the depth of nodes with specific values, load from an external text file, and report on the health of the tree. Additionally, I completed two extensions: adding leaves/height methods, and the ability to delete nodes.

*Evaluation Comments*
* Could break out a traversing the list method
* TDD would be close to a 4, but not quite there

*Evaluation Scores*
* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby Style: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3


####Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/s-espinosa/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

Over the course of 3 days, I created a class with autocomplete functionality using a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie). From the command line users were able to add individual words, dictionary-length word lists, and Denver addresses stored in a publicly available CSV file to the autocomplete dictionary. Users were also able to select words based on incomplete words. This functionality then prioritized the selected words in future suggestions.

*Evaluation Comments*

* Keep going. You're where we want you to be.


*Evaluation Scores*
* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3


## Team

### Projects

During this module I completed two team projects. For the first project I worked with [Matt Pindell](https://github.com/pindell-matt) on a project that Turing called Hyde (based on and referencing the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static page generating blogging software).

#### (Project Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pindell-matt/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

Matt and I worked to develop Hyde, a static page generating engine that works from the command line in the vein of Jekyll. This was our first paired project, and there were two decisions that Matt and I thought were important up front: work in the same space as much as possible, and get an early start. Both paid off in the end as we were able to work together to complete the project, take time to refactor, and push to complete the two extensions required to push the Functional Expectations portion of our score to a 4. Looking back, I think Matt helped me to develop some solid strategies around refactoring, and breaking up problems, while at the same time feeling like I made meaningful contributions to the shape, logic, and breakthroughs that we had while working towards the end product.

*Evaluation Comments*
* Fully functional
* 97 percent coverage
* 34 tests
* edge cases covered where there's bad user input

*Evaluation Scores*
* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 4
