### Work

This module I completed the following individual work assignments. These assignments were each part of Turing's 'Echo' curriculum, which was described to us as 'jumping into the deep end of the pool.' Timelines felt tight but manageable, and I learned an important lesson: Day 1 is not break time. Get to work! Get going! Get moving! You'll have a much better chance of sleeping the night before a project is due.

#### Mastermind

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/s-espinosa/mastermind)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/mastermind.markdown)

In this one week project, I built a REPL interface that allowed a user to play the game **Mastermind**. In order to be successful, the game needed to include interactive play that allowed users to guess a string of four colors and receive feedback on whether they had successfully guessed a secret string of colors. Additional basic menu functionality, time tracking, and a "cheat" option were also required.

*Evaluation Comments*
* Fancy game with some difficulty levels
* Pretty solid mechanics and "getting things done" - able to manipulate the language to achieve what you want
* Bigger point is to keep thinking about the structure of our code at a high level and ask whether the way we structure the code matches with the way the problem is conceptually structured


*Evaluation Scores*
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerables & Collections: 3
* REPL Interface & Game Functionality: 4
* Breaking Logic Into Components: 2


####Binary Search Tree

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/s-espinosa/binary_search_trees)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/binary_search_tree.markdown)

Over the course of 3 days, I created a binary search tree class that had the ability to add new nodes, sort nodes, identify the max/min value, check to see if values were included, report on the depth of nodes with specific values, load from an external text file, and report on the health of the tree. Additionally, I completed two extensions: adding leaves/height methods, and the ability to delete nodes.

*Evaluation Comments*
* Could break out a traversing the list method
* TDD would be close to a 4, but not quite there

*Evaluation Scores*
* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby Style: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 3


####Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/s-espinosa/sorting_suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

Using Test Driven Development, I created classes for four separate sorting algorithms, and an alternative implementation of one of those algorithms. I also created a namespaced Benchmarking class that allowed me to determine which of the sorting algorithms worked the fastest on a given hash. I completed all extensions for this project.

*Evaluation Comments*
* One thing to consider when refactoring is if you can put restrictions on yourself. How would you do this if you didn't allow yourself to use X method?


*Evaluation Scores*
* Functional Expectations: 4
* Testing: 4
* Ruby Style: 3
* Organization: 4


####Complete Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/s-espinosa/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

Over the course of 3 days, I created a class with autocomplete functionality using a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie). From the command line users were able to add individual words, dictionary-length word lists, and Denver addresses stored in a publicly available CSV file to the autocomplete dictionary. Users were also able to select words based on incomplete words. This functionality then prioritized the selected words in future suggestions.

*Evaluation Comments*

* Keep going. You're where we want you to be.


*Evaluation Scores*
* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3


## Team

### Projects

During this module I completed two team projects. For the first project I worked with [Matt Pindell](https://github.com/pindell-matt) on a project that Turing called Hyde (based on and referencing the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static page generating blogging software). For the second, I worked with [Kris Foss](https://github.com/kristindiannefoss) on Turing's Black Thursday project in which we created repositories and analysis tools for mock sales data for an Etsy-like marketplace.

#### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/pindell-matt/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

Matt and I worked together to develop Hyde, a static page generating engine that works from the command line in the vein of Jekyll. This was our first paired project and there were two decisions that Matt and I thought were important up front: work in the same space as much as possible, and get an early start. Both paid off in the end as we were able to work together to complete the project, take time to refactor, and push to complete the two extensions required to push the Functional Expectations portion of our score to a 4. Looking back, I think Matt helped me to develop some solid strategies around refactoring, and breaking up problems, while at the same time feeling like I made meaningful contributions to the shape, logic, and breakthroughs that we had while working towards the end product.

*Evaluation Comments*
* Fully functional
* 97 percent coverage
* 34 tests
* edge cases covered where there's bad user input

*Evaluation Scores*
* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* Looping or Recursion: 4

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* Kris was the first person I paired with today who went through the tests provided to identify all of the methods that the Robot class needed to have. It was just an approach that no one else brought to the problem that I thought was both refreshing and pretty smart. To me, it showed a real understanding of the testing process, the relationship between tests and the code it's testing, and just a general sense of how code works (i.e. the relationship between an object and its methods).
* Chris did a great job taking control and driving the project. He was able to keep things moving and actually implement code while both Thom and I lobbed ideas at him. It's hard with shorter projects, but I think as a group we could've been better at sharing that responsibility and giving Chris some time to pitch ideas and some relief from the nitty gritty of making things work.
* It's great to bounce ideas around with Thom. Multiple times in our short session (and in other interactions we've had), I felt he helped me to think through the problem, poked holes in some of my initial thoughts, and provided ideas for other ways to approach the issue at hand. It's hard in a short session, but I think as a group we could potentially do a better job of sharing the 'driving' responsibility to make sure it didn't feel like Thom and I were telling Chris what to do the whole time.

### Being a Community Member

* Sal is great to pair with, he really takes time to explain why he's doing certain things so I can understand. I felt like I learned more about Ruby from the pairing. He's patient, smart, and kind. I don't know what to suggest to do in the future and what is standing between him and his potential. He seems like he's getting to great heights all by himself. I really enjoyed working with Sal.
* Sal is great at contributing his ideas without overriding the collaborative process. If we teamed up again, we could take turns on who's driving to shake up the dynamics of the group.
* Sal did an excellent job communicating with the team and sharing ideas. Something the team could do better next time, we should have run the unit tests first to establish a solid baseline.

### Playing a Part

During my first module at Turing I've continuously worked to cultivate relationships with my in-module peers, as well as the larger Turing community. By and large this has come from simply being a decent human being trying to be there to listen when someone needed to vent, help with a project, or a pair to go over and think through Ruby exercises. My proudest moments have been quiet ones: someone from a later module saying "I like Sal" when they heard I was going to be paired with a person in their posse for a project; someone in my cohort jokingly calling me 'sensei,' and asking if I could pair on an exercise; staying late, after I knew I had finished all the work that I would do for the day, to walk through Enigma/Night Writer logic, or act as part of the most helpful peanut gallery I've ever been a part of as another pair finished their work for the day. I've consistently shown up to work with my posse, and took lead on two of the projects that we completed, though it honestly feels like the most important time we had there was talking about Star Wars, projects we were working on, and everything besides the posse challenges. I learned that the quickest way to make someone's day was to compliment them on a t-shirt, sticker, or background image both by being on the giving and receiving end of those compliments. I feel like our cohort took a little while to get used to each other, but now that we have I find that we're constantly looking for ways to be nice to each other. Maybe because we all know how draining this has been. My contributions haven't been formally organized or presented, but I do think I've consciously worked to see if I could make Turing a better place for the students.
