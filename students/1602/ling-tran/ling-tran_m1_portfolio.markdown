### Attendance
This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an absence on Thursday, February 18 to Friday, February 19 due to Strep Throat. While recovering the following week also made an effort to attend classes and work on the first team project.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

* Jungle Beats
* Night Writer

##### Jungle Beats - Iterative Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lingtran/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In this three-day project I implemented a linked list with recursion.

Assessed by: Mike

Notes:
* jb - 10 runs, 24 assertions
* list - 8 runs, 25 assertions
* node - 3 tests, 5 assertions
* Clever use of methods, really like how count is calculated.
* The next node method is pretty great.
* Could push some logic from jb to list.
* Testing could use a couple more edge cases.

##### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lingtran/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

In this week-long project I built a Night Writer tool used from the command line that takes a plain text file to create a Braille simulation file.

Assessed by: Horace

Notes:
* Crammed a lot of conceptual intensity into a small amount of code
* Really getting mileage out of the data structures and the methods that we know
* Appreciate your ability to speak to and explain the code really thoroughly, and your keen awareness of the various flaws or gaps
* Testing is ok but really falls into the high level test-last category
* I think more diligent and especially more granular testing up front would help us work through some of these more intricate methods (and help avoid bugs in them)
* Ruby style is pretty good -- looked at a couple small things like class method invocation syntax (. instead of ::), ternaries (avoid if more than 15 characters), and variable assignment inline with method invocation
* Project does basic things pretty well but falls short on some requirements

### Blog Post

---> share link to gist blog post

## __Team Projects__
---
I completed the following individual work this module:

* HTTP Yeah You Know
* Black Thursday

#### HTTP Yeah You Know Me
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/lingtran/HTTPYYKM)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

Project Partner: Kris

Assessed by: Horace

Notes:
* like all the notes and brainstorming docs
* Got a DTR doc in the repo waaaat !!
* Had a few hiccups around game functionality but were able to troubleshoot them fairly quickly
* Project organizes responsibilities around a central Server class which includes various modules to handle the specific jobs it needs (responding, parsing requests, etc etc)
* Tricky problem with this organizational approach is it still allows us to intermix all the instance variables between the class and its various modules -- the modules we have actually depend on the set up and values of various ivars in other modules or the base class to function properly
* Lots of use of modules which is cool; hopefully learned a lot from that
* Some good variety of tests - hitting some integration tests with faraday; some unit tests with modules etc
* nice use of faraday to hit the server in the tests
* collaboration process seems to have been healthy and successful

#### Feedback to Me
https://github.com/turingschool/feedback

**Instructor feedback from Jeff**


**Project DTR memos**
* [HTTP Yeah You Know Me - DTR memo](https://github.com/lingtran/HTTPYYKM/blob/master/DTR_22FEB2016.md)
* [Black Thursday - DTR memo](https://github.com/drew-t/black_thursday/blob/master/DTR_29FEB2016.md)


**In-class pairing partners' feedback**
* Kris:
> Ling is really knowledgeable and logical, she really knows what she's doing.  She's a super fast typer, which is an asset as a programmer.  She would be a great partner on any project.  As a team, it would be good for me to learn how to share files back and forth, I need to learn more about using git, when we started I was trying to also type the pseudo code we were talking through while she typed and that didn't make any sense.  I don't know what she could do better, she's awesome.  I don't know what stands between her and where she could be because I think she's further along the road, I can't see that far.  (I'm sorry, that's not super helpful.)  But the pairing was really successful for me, she's an ideal partner.  I think we got somewhere and we also had fun doing it.

* Drew:
> We were both able to contribute back and forth.  Often one of us might not know a specific syntax and the other did.  We also both approached problems differently which led to better solutions.

* Thom:
> Ling works really hard to understand why things work, and not just how they work. We could of have slowed down a little as a team to stay on the same page with each other.

### Playing a Part

* Joined #snack-time Slack channel to plan welcome mixer event for 1603 students. Will be participating in its implementation.
* Meeting posse for almost every morning with the exception of absences due to Strep Throat illness and Joan Clarke Society weekly convening.
* Had pairing sessions with later module students Kimi, JP, Dan, and Nick.
* Beyond current student community, I have a couple Turing alumni mentors who were able to pair with me a few times and have been able to start cultivating a relationship with them.
