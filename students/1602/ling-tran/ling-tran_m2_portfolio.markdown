### Attendance
100%

### Work

I started an individual side project this module that is still a work in progress:

* Jr Dev Interview Prep App

I would like to start working on another side project and potentially consider writing it in Clojure (dreaming!):

* Flashcard app that helps automate learning schedule

##### Jr Dev Interview Prep App (WIP)

* [GitHub URL](INSERT URL)
* [README](INSERT URL)
* [Original Assignment](INSERT URL)

In this three-day project I implemented a linked list using iterative solutions. This project laid the foundation for understanding the Ruby object model (or what object oriented programming means in general). I saw how different objects point to each other, which underpins what return values are generated. This project also allowed me to contextualize a later lesson on "the stack". I would not have been able to implement a solution for this initial project on such an abstract topic without talking through the subject during the week with my mentor Sally. I still think about linked lists while working through problems, whether projects or paired exercises.

Project Partners: Drew, Mark

Assessed by: Andrew

Notes:
* Testing:
  - Number of tests decent
  - Consider scope of data needed for test - as little data as possible
  - If data is being reused outside of a test, then create a test helper method to generate that data
  - Consider name of tests as related to what is being tested (ex., model vs. controller)
  - Uniqueness and validation tests - set up both valid and invalid data in test; be mindful of difference between #valid? and #save
  - Preferred Minitest syntax: ```assert(object).respond_to?(:table)```, rather than ```assert_equal object, :table```
  - Would have liked to see more scoping in feature tests
* Tip for DTR coverage:
  - Talk about style guide (hash syntax, how to express methods, number of lines, structure of tests, etc.)
* Other areas for refactoring:
  - Consider edge case for missing URL
  - Validator object in Server
  - Separate methods for #get_data and #format_data
  - Consider scope of responsiveness

**Project Partners' feedback**
* Mark | Rush Hour:

> Ling: Bulbasaur is very focused on writing tests and having it drive the development of our code. She's very focused on details without losing focus on the goals to achieve certain functionality. Bulbasaur writes extremely clean and well-formatted code. She's very easy to work with and a great part of any group. She also sings a lot and brings snacks. I hope to be paired with Bulbasaur on a project in the future.

* Drew | Rush Hour:

> Ling was very good at managing the team throughout the project.  She kept up with the waffle cards and kept us on track by regularly checking in.  She kept a very positive attitude during the project which helped me to keep going when I didn’t want to anymore.  She was always prepared and always working to improve the project and the group members.

* Colin Osborn, 1603 | Pairing:

> I worked with Ling on the Night Writer project a few different times looking for insight on how to solve my problems. Ling was an excellent person to talk to, not just because she had personal experience with the project, but she was always very clear and communicative. She never gave me an answer, but was always able to point into the right direction, or help me in thinking in a certain concept or direction. It’s very clear Ling knows what she’s talking about, and considering how much help I solicited from her, she’s also very eager to help and also learn about other ways to do the same problem.

* Deb Hamel, 1602 | Pairing:

> Ling is one of the smartest and most insightful members of the Turing community. She has taken time to pair with me multiple times and I always learn something about coding and  something about myself. She is focused, and effective in her work style. She is honest, caring and so much fun. She is a talented programmer and will be very successful. I hope she will overcome some of the irrational anxiety that crops up for her, but I do also love her softer side.

**Feedback from mentor**

* Minnie Lee | Turing alum, 1502 | Paired during Rush Hour:

> you guys worked pretty well together despite some road blocks. What you guys learned from this project, in my opinion, was to take breaks when you're really stuck, and to debug and walk through your code to better understand errors.

### Giving Feedback
** Project partners' feedback**

* Mark | Rush Hour:

> For Squirtle (Mark):
Squirtle is very versatile. He is strong in every possible way, in addition to being a fun and compassionate team member. He is tenacious with debugging - using tools to pry into the issue rather than just thinking and talking about possible sources for issues. I learned to be more tenacious in this way by working with Squirtle. The only area of improvement I can identify in working with Squirtle is perhaps being more patient with other people's workflow! Other than that, with an established rapport, I imagine working with Squirtle will be just as awesome again.

* Drew | Rush Hour:

> For Charmander(Drew):
This will be my second time partnering with Charmander on a project. He is a steady partner with a rich inner life. I learned to be braver in exploring options and refactoring in the problem-solving process from him. He was markedly proactive with writing tests, which was something he had been working on since working together on Black Thursday in module 1. The only area for improvement I can identify for Charmander is that sometimes he can get caught up in his thought process and not communicate it immediately with his project partner. This is something I'm flexible with but it might be misleading for a more sensitive project partner. It'll be hilarious if I get paired with Charmander again.

* Claudia | Habitask (Little Shop):

> Claudia is extremely detail oriented and able to communicate her logic breakdown in discussions. On the latter quality, compared to all my project partners to date, she has exhibited the strongest communication abilities in the problem-solving process. On the flip side of the same coin, Claudia may have the tendency to lose sight of the big picture by digging too deep into details. I am not sure if may be this is just my perception and I can see how others may have the same misunderstanding. So a simple preface to the effect of, "I know xyz is the big picture, but at the moment, I think abc should be considered either now or later," could be a helpful communication device. Because Claudia is also very self-aware, I can tell she has been practicing this more towards the end of our project timeline. Claudia is a joy to work with because she is thoughtful, calm, and a fellow chocolate ambassador. She is a strong member for any team she is assigned to work with. Thanks for being you, Claudia!

* Matt | Habitask (Little Shop):

> I am impressed by Matt's relationship management skills working with a relatively large project group for nearly two full weeks. He is able to walk the fine line of asserting his opinions while also listening to his teammates - I guess some people would call this the ability to influence. He also has mad googling skills that helped get us over issues when we got really stuck. (Teach me your ways, Matt!) Lastly, through working with him on the Little Shop project, I find myself formatting my own code better because he is unwaveringly disciplined in writing clean and well-organized code. He is also a very fun team member. If Matt were to improve upon something, I might suggest not being as afraid to assert himself. You have nothing to be afraid of dude!

* Patrick | Habitask (Little Shop):

> Patrick has uncanny focus when working, which makes him a strong project partner because in addition to being focused he is also proactive in seeking solutions and experimenting. Whenever we paired off throughout the project, it felt like we were able to complete user stories or debug quickly because he works with such seamless efficiency. Prior to Little Shop, we had paired for in-class exercises, and it has always been easy collaborating with him. I am impressed by Patrick's ability to retain so much information! If I had to identify an area for Patrick to improve, it may possibly be being more diligent with getting rid of commented out ```byebug``` lines. Patrick is yet another person I would enjoy collaborating with again for all the aforementioned reasons. Execellent work, Patrick!

**Feedback to peers outside of project teams**

* Colin Osborn, 1602 | Pairing:

> I worked with Colin a few times when he was implementing Night Writer. The thing that stands out about Colin is how quickly he puts feedback into action. The first time we worked together, I noticed he was stuck in his head hypothesizing about issues rather than throwing in a pry. So I showed him how to befriend pry. The next day or so, when we worked together again, he was prying away and seemed really comfortable with the tool. I am impressed by how calm Colin is even under pressure and the clarity with which he asks questions. Colin also seems to be more open this module and I am glad that he is letting people into his world!

* Heidi Hoopes | Miyamoto Posse/Pairing:

> Heidi provided assistance a number of times when I was stuck on project issues (especially those pertaining to FactoryGirl!). She was very thoughtful with her questions to get on board and contextualize particular problems. And the best part is that we were always able to get to a solution! I got to know Heidi through participation in the Miyamoto Posse and Clarke Coin hackathon group. She is so knowledgeable and helpful, I don't know how I did not get to know Heidi until this module! Heidi is so strong I am not sure I can identify any areas for improvement. Perhaps adopt another cat if you are not already a cat guardian, Heidi!?

* Erinna Chen, 1511 | Pairing:

> I did not have opportunities to pair with Erinna until this module. She knows so much!!! Despite being a genius, Erinna does not possess an ounce of arrogance. She cares for the community and uses her technical strengths and encouragement to prop others up. I am impressed by how Erinna manages her time, juggling projects with her participation in various time-consuming activities. How does she do it?! I am not sure. I hope to learn as much as possible from Erinna before she finishes Turing. Thanks for all that you do, Erinna!

* Deb Hamel, 1602 | Pairing:

> Deb has a tremendous work ethic and is one of the most compassionate and caring spirits at Turing. When we paired a few times this module, she demonstrated her knowledge of the content but only after encouragement. I think a factor that underlies her timidity is self-doubt, which is KURAZY because she is super smart and can speak about the content. Another contributing factor is that she gets ahead of herself in the thought process before coding anything, which can get her in a pickle. If Deb can figure out how to simply focus without getting loss in her head, she is GOLDEN. Also, I am grateful for having such a wonderful person in 1602 - she embodies the kind soul that is 1602.
