#### Feedback to Me

**Project Partners' feedback**

* Claudia | The Pivot:

>  Ling, your way of tackling bugs and using all the tools we have learned has taught me a lot during these last 2 projects. You are very confident and open to try out new things (like presenters and services) and efficiently find the resources to implement them in the appropriate way. This encouraged me to also try out new things on my own. I was insecure about my skills and asked you for help and feedback a lot last weekend. When you just gave me some hints and put things back into my hands I was disappointed. Looking back I have to thank you for that because I had to figure out things on my own and this taught me a lot. I feel so much more confident after the pivot, partly because of that. I wish you stepped up a bit more when we were trying to find consensus on decisions because you have such a good grasp on good programming strategies. You have a lot to say and to give to projects that way. Also, I enjoy working with you because of your positive spirit and your caring personality and your commitment to good work

* Alex | The Pivot:

>  Working with you was pretty cool since we got along very well when it came time for us to pair together. I like how open you were with all of us by keeping us in check whenever the conversation was going on a tangent by saying, "this isn't top priority at the moment." We really needed someone to remind us all the time about that because the team itself was already in a huge tangent to begin with. I also liked how even when moments were stressful you were able to control yourself in times where we needed to just come to a conclusion and come up with something to implement on the project. I'd love for you to bring that "project manager" side of you next time you find yourself in a group situation because it was very valuable. Your say in situations were always important because it made the whole team take a step back and realize what truly was top priority. Thanks for being an amazing team member.

* Ali | The Pivot:

> Ling, working with you has been a unique and knowledge experience. You are smart, motivated, and determined. I appreciated your ideas and approaches of trying new strategies and taking on challenges that you felt you can tackle. Its great to question your peers about an approach so everyone can improve from it, however I would recommend for future reference, allow your teammate to explain there approach before giving them your advice. Communication is key to proper teamwork, allowing a team member to explain something fully then following up with more questions until you fully understand their approach would help you give better ideas in order to help out your team member.

**Feedback from peers outside of team projects**

* Kimiko Kano, 1511 | Pairings :

> Ling has a been a great moral support for me over the last couple modules. She always had positive things to say to me when she could tell that I was feeling stressed and she did of great job of cheering me up. I've paired with her a handful of times and can tell she has a good grasp of what she is doing and an enthusiasm for it as well. Additionally, even when she's stressed she's always able to put on a smile and laugh through any difficulty. I'm excited to see where her career takes her and wish we could have worked on something together (although maybe we will in the future!)

* Jon Liss (Little Brother), 1602 | Community Member :

> :link: :tram: <- you better keep that in this feedback or it’s all invalid. Ling is a pretty cool person.  That’s not to say she’s perfect, i never said that, but she’s pretty cool.  So far throughout turing she’s proven herself to be a pretty slick programmer too. Did you know she knows a little Chinese? I didn’t make that up.  She’s also related to David Hasselhoff.  Ok I made that one up, but that doesn’t make it any less true.  Anyway, why didn’t you pair us up on any projects?  I think we would make a great team.  Because my of my prior feedback pertaining to her slickness in programming.  This feedback is not super grammatically correct.  It’s also over.

### Giving Feedback
** Project partners' feedback**

* Alex | The Pivot:

> Alex, you are very knowledgeable and willing to share information and resources with the team. The styling you did for the views were fantastic and I am grateful for having paired with you to work on some of them to up my own game. You are very self-aware and proactive about improving your work flow. Something that may be helpful to recognize when under a time crunch is that the tendency to get caught up on what is going wrong big picture wise may not be helping the cause at the moment. I'm proud that we managed to push through the mini hackathon together the day before the deadline.

* Ali | The Pivot:

> Ali, you are a kind team member and it boggles my mind to witness your work ethic given the number of responsibilities you have outside of Turing. Implementing the admin functionalities was not easy. One thing that you may consider working on is becoming more deliberate and self-aware about how you may not be communicating. You have a lot of ideas and positive intentions, but you tend to say things that do not represent what you mean, which makes it difficult for people to be on the same page. And a number of team members felt like they were not being listened to because your communication style seems dismissive and we were often interrupted when trying to convey our ideas. There were also times when someone asked a question around the feature logic, but you responded in such a manner that suggested you did not think the other person understood fundamental ActiveRecord or Rails, which was not the case. I know you care about each of the team members, so working on improving your communication style would better help convey your positive intent and contribute to more positive team productivity.

* Claudia | The Pivot:

> Claudia, working with you a second time under a different group dynamic was very rewarding. Implementing the favoriting feature was hairy but you managed to execute with great test coverage and understandable code. It was great to see you gain confidence in trusting your own abilities to build something and debug. One thing that may be helpful for your debugging process is to simply dive in and investigate the problem according to given feedback, rather than theorizing about the issue. I think this was a habit at the start of the project and understandably since it was a tricky feature to make happen, but I saw tremendous growth in your willingness to just dive in and pry around. I am also impressed with your compassion and ability to navigate a tough group dynamic. I hope to be as resilient as you are.


**Feedback to peers outside of project teams**

* Kimiko Kano, 1511 | Pairings :

> Kimi is one of the most generous spirits at Turing because she is very giving with her time to support other students (including myself of course!). I've started pairing with her since my first module and am always learning from her, particularly on debugging techniques and cultivating a competitive state of mind to 'crush it'. While I'm sad to see her time at the basement come to a close, I'm excited for any team who gets to work with Kimi because she offers a lot on the hard skills front and herself simply being an all-around awesome person. They should count themselves lucky!

* Erinna Chen, 1511 | Pairings :

> Erinna continued to be an amazing mentor this module. I've learned a lot under her guidance in navigating various problems. She also offered significant emotional support during a particularly stressful module for me. She was attentive in ways that was surprising. If there is one recommendation I can give to Erinna, I would say she doesn't have to be so hard on herself regarding social skills. Her team player orientation and conscientiousness are qualities that standout and anyone is able to see that. I'll miss you tremendously Erinna!

* Jon Liss (Little Brother), 1602 | Community Member :

> Little Brother is a poet, and he doesn't even know it. Well, maybe he does because he occasionally quotes Shakespeare that one time and attempted to write it in binary code. This just goes to show how much of his vitality draws from solving problems through programming. He also enjoys teaching and seeks opportunities to improve himself as a teacher. As his older sister, I'm obligated to say it requires a lot of training to be a good teacher - like Yoda (or perhaps that's not the best example of a great teacher unless one's educator status is measured by an aptitude for exercising Socratic methodologies? Does that even apply in this situation? - so there is a ways to go. On the bright side, time is on his side! The programming force seems to be with him and I'm excited to see the amazing things he'll crank out next module. ClarkeBase was a cool project and it would have been a Fantastic Four convening. But alas, Chinese words spoke to me, if words can speak. All in all, Little Brother continued to crush stuff this module. Boy this paragraph object seems to break SRP and may be a bit DRY. Refactor later? For now, #awesomepossum.
