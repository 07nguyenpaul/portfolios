### Work

I completed the following projects during the module:

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](git@github.com:seeker105/rush-hour-skeleton.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

We created an app that accepts HTTP messages containing data. The app stores the data in an ActiveRecord database. It allows clients to view certain data analytics regarding the data that has been sent.

Team: Jonathan Liss & Christopher Soden & Hedy Woo

Evaluator: Rachel

Notes:

all iterations are complete; data in iteration 8 is not scoped per client
client methods tested for muliple clients sometimes, but not consistent
feature tests looked good -- good use of scoping to specific HTML elements
good use of ActiveRecord for queries
views looked good -- no logic leaking through
inclusion of module in server file is somewhat confusing - sets instance variables without being clear
some methods in Client Parser module should be built in Event, Url, and Client classes
The project will be assessed with the following rubric:


1. Functional Expectations: 3

2. Test-Driven Development: 3

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3

5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic: 3

6. View Layer: 3

### Playing a Part

I spent 2 hours tutoring Jason Hanna on 4/5/2016. He was working on the enigma project. I met with him again for 2 half-hour sessions on 4/6/2016. I think it was helpful; at the end of our meeting on 4/6 he said, "The code works. And I understand it! I didn't think those two things could happen at the same time."
