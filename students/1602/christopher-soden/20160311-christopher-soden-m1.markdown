# Christopher Soden - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goals evolved over the course of the module. I am eager to pursue such an
interesting and challenging field. My primary goal was and is to greatly
improve my programming skills and become a valuable job candidate. As I progressed
through the module, I began to refine these goals. To accomplish the high
level goal I needed to improve my knowledge of tools. This included becoming more
familiar with the Atom Text Editor's functions, keyboard shortcuts and available
packages. This also meant gaining more familiarity with the Ruby language- the
different built in functions and their use and syntax. Learning about using pry
for debugging.

### Work

I completed the following individual projects during the module:

#### Jungle Beats
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/seeker105/linked_list_project)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

I created a node class and a singly linked-list using Ruby. Doing this project
really caused me to consider the benefits of a DOUBLY linked-list vs. singly
linked.

* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Looping *or* Recursion: 3


#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/seeker105/Night_Writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

I created a master class that executed the application, and helper classes with
special functionality split out. This project really challenged me to grow in
handling string processing and File IO. I came to better understand the .gsub
method and the implications of passing objects rather than values. I had to do
some research to find the correct syntax for using regex's; but the biggest
challenge was looking at the special cases around contractions and splitting the
output into 80 character lines. I learned more about the match method - eventually
finding a way to use that to accomplish the split.

* Overall Functionality: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Breaking Logic into Components: 4


## Team

### Projects

I worked on two team projects during the first module.

#### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ColinOsborn/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

Colin Osborn and I built a basic blog creation engine that takes parameters
and creates a blog file structure.
The biggest challenge of this project was learning how to work with the file
structure. I found the Dir class through my reading, but Jared pointed me to a
module called FileUtils that had some even more effective methods.

### Feedback To Me
From Colin Osborn:
Working with Chris was great, his schedule was very accommodating for collaboration and he also made himself available at all times to answer questions. I feel like his strengths were my weaknesses and he was great at driving home TDD. If we were to work together once again I would be in agreement that more defined organization would help most issues and would fix possible time pitfalls. I'd say for things Chris could work on would be the same issues that I have, which would be tackling problems in smaller pieces. I think the only thing that stand's between Chris now and where they could be is just more practice, he seem's to be working from a solid foundation and logic is usually on the right path. All in all, it was a great experience working with Chris and learning all that I could from him.

#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/seeker105/headcount)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Matt Pindell and I built a program to read in data from various CSV files,
establish relationships between data elements and answer certain questions from
the data.
This project definitely developed our skills with hashes. The complexity of
the data hashes we had to create and the hash-parameters passed
into and returned from the methods made this a very challenging problem.

### Posse Challenges

My posse worked on the following challenges:

#### College Scorecard Challenge
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/GKhalsa/college_scorecard)

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave constructive feedback to Kris Foss and Claudia Kiesenhofer regarding
in-class projects we worked on together. And I gave feedback to Sal Espinosa and
Thomas Pickett on an in-class assignment the three of us performed.

I was able to give more thorough feedback to Colin Osborn because we were paired
on the same project for a whole week.

### Being a Community Member

### Feedback to me

Thomas Pickett: "Chris is extremely curious about how things work in ruby. We could shake up the dynamics of the group by alternating driver/navigator positions. Chris could work on his mechanical skills to navigate his computer better."

Sal Espinosa: "Chris did a great job taking control and driving the project. He was able to keep things moving and actually implement code while both Thom and I lobbed ideas at him. It's hard with shorter projects, but I think as a group we could've been better at sharing that responsibility and giving Chris some time to pitch ideas and some relief from the nitty gritty of making things work."

Kris Foss: "I didn't have a lot of time working with Chris but the time I have had, I've been really impressed.  Chris's background in computer science really shines through his logical programming.  He isn't arrogant, despite how advanced is knowledge is.  He's good at explaining concepts and always willing to step in and help.  He has a real eagerness and passion for programming and I can't wait to see what he creates.  He's also kind and approachable and he would make a great partner for any project."

Feedback From Me

### Playing a Part

Everytime I saw a classmate struggling with a problem I worked to help them. One example: the day before the lesson on binary I overheard Patrick Hardy say that he was very confused by it. I explained what I knew to him with a diagram. He later asked me for the diagram and used it to help his partner in lesson. I used the same explanation with my partner for the lesson - Jeneve Parrish - and she said it made the subject very clear. 

I did reasearch on the Atom text editor and posted information on it in Slack. I
showed other classmates some shortcuts for programming and debugging with Ruby.

I went to the LGBT dinner and worked to make connections with people.


### DTR Conversation
**Project:** Headcount

**Group Member Names:** Matt Pindell, Christopher Soden

**What does each group member hope to get out of the project? What are your goals and expectations for the project?**  
**Chris** Hopes to get 4's and 3's - as well as develop his skills with File Input/Output as well as Enumerables.  
**Matt** Also hopes to improve his understanding of File Input/Output and Enums - and have a strong emphasis on TDD.

**When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?**  
**Chris** - for the project, Chris will be at Turing (approximately) between 8am and 8:30pm during the week, with flexible weekends. Chris also has Appointments at 5pm on both Wednesdays.  
**Matt** - for the project, Matt will be at Turing between 8:30am and 10:30pm during the week, with flexible weekends.
We are planning on working together, at Turing, from 4:00pm to 8:30pm on most days (the first Monday and both Wednesdays excluded). On Weekends, we will both meet at Turing at 8:30am and work until approximately 8-9pm, playing the ending time by ear. On the first Monday and both Wednesdays - we will use Screenhero to work together from approximately 7:00pm to 8:30pm.

**How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?**  
Mostly face-to-face, other than that, we can use Screenhero, Slack, and Waffle - we will also exchange cell numbers.

**What is each group memberâ€™s self-identified strength(s) technically? What does each group member want to improve on technically? How can the team assist with these improvements?**

*Strengths*  
**Christopher:** general programming / ruby syntax, IDE navigation, concepts of object-oriented programming.  
**Matt:** putting in the hours and testing (but not always through pure TDD).

*Improvements*  
**Christopher:** breaking things down into their logical components, and appropriately dividing responsibilities between methods, classes, etc. - as well as building on existing strengths. Stronger working knowledge of relevant Ruby tools.  
**Matt:** Would also like a strong working knowledge of relevant Ruby tools - as well as to build up his ability to logically break down his code and keep things DRY.

**Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?**  
Mostly, we'll work together on the entirety of the project - neither of us have any specific features we are averse to or attracted to.

**What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?**  
The project will be on Christopher's GitHub - Matt will be added as a collaborator, and we'll communicate via Git Merge Requests, Waffle, Slack, and in-person conversations.

**What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?**  
That they'll communicate their issues and work with their partner to resolve them.

**How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?**  
All feedback should be specific, actionable, and kind - and, ideally, should be delivered in writing - for future reference.

**Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?**  
Not at this time.
