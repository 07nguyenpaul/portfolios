# Christopher Soden - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My goals evolved over the course of the module. I am eager to pursue such an
interesting and challenging field. My primary goal was and is to greatly
improve my programming skills and become a valuable job candidate. As I progressed
through the module, I began to refine these goals. To accomplish the high
level goal I needed to improve my knowledge of tools. This included becoming more
familiar with the Atom Text Editor's functions, keyboard shortcuts and available
packages. This also meant gaining more familiarity with the Ruby language- the
different built in functions and their use and syntax. Learning about using pry
for debugging.

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Work

I completed the following individual projects during the module:

#### Jungle Beats
* [GitHub URL](git@github.com:seeker105/linked_list_project.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

I created a node class and a singly linked-list using Ruby. Doing this project
really caused me to consider the benefits of a DOUBLY linked-list vs. singly
linked.

### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and the one extension

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques




#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](git@github.com:seeker105/Night_Writer.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

I created a master class that executed the application, and helper classes with
special functionality split out. This project really challenged me to grow in
handling string processing and File IO. I came to better understand the .gsub
method and the fact that we are passing objects rather than values. I had to do
some research to find the correct syntax for using regex's; but the biggest
challenge was looking at the special cases around contractions and splitting the
output into 80 character lines. I learned more about the match method - eventually
finding a way to use that to accomplish the split.

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and two extensions

### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration

### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage


## Team

### Projects

I worked on two team projects during the first module.

#### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](git@github.com:ColinOsborn/hyde.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

Colin Osborn and I built a basic blog creation engine that took some parameters
and created a blog file structure.
The biggest challenge of this project was learning how to work with the file
structure. I found the Dir class through my reading, but Jared pointed me to a
module called FileUtils that had some even more effective methods.

### Feedback To Me
From Colin Osborn:
Working with Chris was great, his schedule was very accommodating for collaboration and he also made himself available at all times to answer questions. I feel like his strengths were my weaknesses and he was great at driving home TDD. If we were to work together once again I would be in agreement that more defined organization would help most issues and would fix possible time pitfalls. I'd say for things Chris could work on would be the same issues that I have, which would be tackling problems in smaller pieces. I think the only thing that stand's between Chris now and where they could be is just more practice, he seem's to be working from a solid foundation and logic is usually on the right path. All in all, it was a great experience working with Chris and learning all that I could from him.

### 1. Functional Expectations

* **2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes**

### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* **3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality**
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* **3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP**
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* **3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring**
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 5. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
* **3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods**
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
* 1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections

### 6. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints
* **3: Five or fewer complaints**
* 2: Six to ten complaints
* 1: More than ten complaints


#### Headcount

* [GitHub URL](git@github.com:seeker105/headcount.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/headcount.markdown)

Matt Pindell and I built a program to read in data from various CSV files,
establish relationships between data elements and answer certain questions from
the data.
This project definitely developed our skills with hashes. The complexity of
the data hashes we had to create from the files and the hash-parameters passed
into and returned from the methods made this a most challenging problem.
The spec requires some rather long method names; their length made their purpose
clear, but it also meant that reusing them in more involved computations lead to
some very long code lines.


## Community

### Giving Feedback

I gave constructive feedback to Kris Foss and Claudia Kiesenhofer regarding
in-class projects we worked on together. And I gave feedback to Sal Espinosa and
Thomas Pickett on an in-class assignment the three of us performed.

I was able to give more thorough feedback to Colin Osborn because we were paired
on the same project for a whole week.

### Being a Community Member

Thomas Pickett: "Chris is extremely curious about how things work in ruby. We could shake up the dynamics of the group by alternating driver/navigator positions. Chris could work on his mechanical skills to navigate his computer better."

Sal Espinosa "Chris did a great job taking control and driving the project. He was able to keep things moving and actually implement code while both Thom and I lobbed ideas at him. It's hard with shorter projects, but I think as a group we could've been better at sharing that responsibility and giving Chris some time to pitch ideas and some relief from the nitty gritty of making things work."

### Playing a Part

Everytime I saw a classmate struggling with a problem I worked to help them. I
did reasearch on the Atom text editor and posted information on it in Slack. I
showed other classmates some shortcuts for programming and debugging with Ruby.

I went to the LGBT dinner and worked to make connections with people.
