### Areas of Emphasis

This module I will focus on building a strong foundation in back-end skills and tools in order to succeed at my personal project in module 3.

Specifically, this involves continuing to keep my Ruby skills sharp by completing 1 exercism per week, developing SQL skills by working through Learn SQL the Hard Way at a pace of 3 exercises per week, and learning React Native through my posse. I also will work with my mentor to build a server on Blue Origin.

I also intend to increase my community involvement by helping Mod 1 students and working with my classmates on outside projects.
