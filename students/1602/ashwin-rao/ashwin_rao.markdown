## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I have almost no coding background. As a result, my primary area of emphasis will be on understanding how to make good decisions in designing programs as well as becoming comfortable with all the tools that ruby makes available.

### Work

#### HTTPYYKM

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/emblou2/http_yeah_you_know_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

The purpose of this project was to create a simple web application that can communicate with a user through http.

**I received the following comments and results:**

"Making progress on decomposition of the system -- have 2 quite useful domain objects in the Request and Response classes and their usage is pretty consistent.

Testing of these 2 also pretty effective -- getting better at carving these chunks to wrap into an object and test - still just need to keep pushing this further.

Interesting discussion around what makes parts of this system hard to test -- if we can't change this then we can at least minimize our dependence on it...

Test suite is pretty good at mixing some integration tests that actually run and hit the server and some unit tests of the request/response objects that are defined."

#### Night Writer

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/theonlyrao/hw/tree/master/night_writer)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

This purpose of this project was to create a program that could be executed from the command line, read a file with contents in English or Braille, translate those contents to the other, and then write the translation to another file.

**I received the following comments and results:**

"I/O is very clean; appreciate isolation of this into its own file with minimal connections to other code. Like overall structure and division of responsibilities between various objects. Seem to be improving a lot in the ability to deconstruct complex processes into code."

#### Jungle Beats

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In this three-day project I implemented a linked list with looping.

**It was evaluated by Andrew with the following results:**

"Tdd - from what was turned in does not appear to have strong use of tdd. We looked at an old commit and saw much better use, however in a final push to finish the project that work was lost and not turned in... good use of loops and understanding of them."

#### Feedback from me

I gave feedback every time the feedback bot requested me to give it.

#### Feedback about me
**from students**

"Ashwin is easy to talk to, flexible and patient. He's easy-going but stays on task and encourages his pairing partner to do the same." - Jeneve Parrish, 2/19/16

**From staff**

=======================================

## Community

This module I attended every meeting of our posse. I also showed enthusiasm for our work, recognized my teammates for their abilities, and encouraged the effort put by the staff into the posses.

On my HTTP project, I was paired with someone who dropped out of Turing a few days into the project. On my Black Friday project, I was paired with someone who realized that she would be repeating within a few days of beginning the project.

In both of these occasions, I tried to serve my parter and develop their skills instead of abandoning them in order to achieve passing grades and graduate from the module.
