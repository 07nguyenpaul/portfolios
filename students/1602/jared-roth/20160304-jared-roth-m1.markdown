Enigma takes various combinations of strings, keys, and dates and either encrypts, decrypts, or cracks the string.

Reviewed by Mike

__Comments:__

* 16 runs, 29 assertions
* It encrypts
* it decrypts
* it does not blend
* test should be in separate files, in a test directory
* cracked does not work, small error due to an unclearness in spec
* Some opportunities to refactor out to additional classes and methods.
* Overall, well written code, good project, next time would like to focus on more division into classes.

__Scores:__

* Had conversations about refactoring and opportunities to make code cleaner and generally more readable.
* A small bug with going to the root, but nothing to concerning.
* Able to talk about all the code and it was knowledgable
* Didn't use many enumerables but there were not many opportunities.
* Testing was good. Could have have some more edge cases particularly in taking in the args
