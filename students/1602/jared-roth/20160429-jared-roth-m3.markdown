The Pivot takes an existing Little Shop store and converts it into a multi-tenancy store while also changing it's focus. We converted our store into a platform for donating to people in need.

* Be sure to test your model logic in model tests
* You can use collection and member in your routes files
* I like how you've used a concerns module to DRY out your controllers
* Make sure view level stuff isn't happening in the model

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* Claudia Kiesenhofer
>Working with Claudia, I noticed a strong desire to completely understand each piece of the project before moving on. This is a great asset to her learning. On this same note, it sometimes prevented us from moving forward when others _did_ know how to proceed. My only advice on this point would just to be a little more willing to allow others to try out an idea even if she doesn't fully understand it. Allow them to demonstrate how it works sometimes rather than only relying on verbal explanation.

* Josh Washke
>Josh has a great grasp of ruby, rails, and programming in general. He understands project structure and relationships well and is thus able to implement new features in the appropriate place without difficulty. Being forced to work on different sides of the country for much of the project, I think that it strengthened his git workflow tremendously, but it also revealed how each member of the team has room to improve understanding of the git tools available to us.

* Gurusundesh Khalsa
>Sunny is exceptionally easy to work with. He always makes it a point to ensure that you know you've been heard when discussing potentially opposing views on a topic before offering his counterpoint. Since we were forced to work on different sides of the country for much of the project, I think that his git workflow was improved tremendously, but it also revealed how each member of the team has room to improve understanding of the git tools available to us and establishing best practices for distributed projects. This is one area I can see easy growth in the near future.

### Being a Community Member

* Hedy Woo
>From the beginning of the project, Hedy was very proactive in all regards: taking notes, creating waffle cards, initiating group planning/scheduling conversations, etc. I think that the area where she could realize the most improvement is in the details of communication. (Understanding that english is her second/third/fourth language whereas I speak it and only it.) There were times when either something written (like a waffle card) or spoken didn't quite make sense to me or another team member and we mentioned it, and if there was an effort to clarify, the clarification was the same as the initial statement. I think that making an effort to approach a thought from a different perspective could improve these moments of miscommunication.

* Jon Liss
>Jon is experienced with programming and it shows. He is generally well-aware of what is going wrong in a given moment and usually knows how to fix it. With this experience, though, comes the danger of over-complicating some solutions because of "legacy" knowledge. I think the simplest way of improving would be to focus on how things *should* be done (as in: best practices for whatever type of project it is) rather than how they *could* be done.

* Kris Foss
>While on this project, Kris endured a lot of conflict that didn't involve her. (Hint: it involved me) She made great efforts to be a peacemaker and did well to continue working throughout the struggles. I think that one area of improvement for Kris would be "code quality." Referring mostly to visual structure things like whitespace and indentation and more specifically to html. I think this will come naturally as she grows in understanding of the fundamental meaning and structure of the code, but focusing on gaining that understanding will be helpful.


In the first week of the module I, along with Drew Thompson, led an elective for new students to help get them acquainted with system and editor shortcuts, bash profile setups, and other useful productivity tools.
