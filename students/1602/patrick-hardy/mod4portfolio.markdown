## Community

### Giving Feedback

Chad Ellison - I had a really great time working with Chad on Asteroids. I was amazed at how effortlessly Chad was able to motivate and invest days on end into the project. Despite his diligence late night coding binges, I never felt pressured to do the same. It really seemed like we both just really enjoyed working on the project, so there was never any stress or tension over working on it. I may recommend that Chad try to break goals into smaller executable pieces - e.g. when trying to integrate a multiplayer, I feel like we took on a huge task without understanding the scope of this feature. This was definitely one of my favorite projects of Turing, much because Chad was so enjoyable to work with.
