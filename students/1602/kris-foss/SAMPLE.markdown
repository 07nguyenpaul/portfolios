## Individual
### Areas of Emphasis

This module was a crash course in Ruby and programming in general for me, my
goals were to get fluent enough to meet the requirements.  My ultimate goal is
to excel programming but as a more achievable goal, I just wanted to become
functional.  You cannot build well on a spotty foundation.  

It is hard to define a particular area of emphasis, given the voids that needed
to be filled in my tool box.  In six weeks, I will have gone from barely
comprehending pragmatic studio, to writing a full on enigma encryptor.  I have
spent time doing enums exercises, ruby exercises, exercims, and having pairings
with my mentors to work out where I need the most improvement.  I truly feel
I have put 100% into this module and into making this the best next chapter of
my life.  I have come really far and I'm proud of what I have done and who I
have become.  

### End of Module Assessment

* Collaboration: 3

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub Project URL](https://github.com/kristindiannefoss/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In this project I implemented a linked list. It was
evaluated by Mike with the following results:

Assessed By: Mike

##### Notes:
* 10 runs, 8 assertions
* Used elephants and lines of elephants to implement a linked list.
* Good use of looping to traverse said linked list.
* Good division of logic between line and elephants.

##### Functional Expectations

* 1: Application is missing more than one base expectation

##### Test-Driven Development

* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

##### Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

##### Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jcasimir/robodoku)
* [Original Assignment](http://github.com/turingschool/challenges/robodoku.markdown)

In this week-long project I built a sudoku-solving machine. It was
evaluated by Mike with the following results:

##### Notes:
* 18 tests, good coverage, does look at some edge cases.
* Runner does not work, some issues with randomized key generation, that caused
issues, when running.
* Well thought out code, decrypting and encrypting methods work in pry
* Crack method also works using the brute force method.
* Some opportunities to refactor by pulling out methods into classes
for purposes of organization, some repetition in code.

##### Overall Functionality
* 1: Application is missing two operations or crashes during normal usage

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

##### Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

# Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:
https://github.com/turingschool/feedback

### HTTPYYKM

Repo: https://github.com/lingtran/HTTPYYKM

##### Notes
Ling & Kris --
* like all the notes and brainstorming docs
* Got a DTR doc in the repo waaaat !!
* Had a few hiccups around game functionality but were able to troubleshoot them fairly quickly
* Project organizes responsibilities around a central Server class which includes various modules to handle the specific jobs it needs (responding, parsing requests, etc etc)
* Tricky problem with this organizational approach is it still allows us to intermix all the instance variables between the class and its various modules -- the modules we have actually depend on the set up and values of various ivars in other modules or the base class to function properly
* Lots of use of modules which is cool; hopefully learned a lot from that
* Some good variety of tests - hitting some integration tests with faraday; some unit tests with modules etc
* nice use of faraday to hit the server in the tests
* collaboration process seems to have been healthy and successful

##### Overall Functionality

* 3: Application implements iterations 0 - 4

##### Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

##### Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

##### Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
