## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into the first module I had three main goals. Without having any programing I first of all wanted to find out if I actually like to program and am capable and interested in understanding the concepts of programing languages. The second goal was to check out the community of programer and find out if feel I can thrive in that environment. Thirdly I wanted to really understand the concepts of Ruby and learn how to effectively use its rich library to create programs using its rich library of options. At the end of module 1 I am very happy about the choice I made. I really enjoy programing and feel very much a part of this community already. I am still in progress reaching my third goal and realize it will probably take quite some time of practise to fully getting there. I am satisfied with my progress so far though.

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Junglebeats Linked List

* [GitHub URL](git@github.com:Claudia108/jungle-beats.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following 2 team projects:

#### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/claudia108/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* Code Sanitation: 4

Notes from Mike: 
* all expected functionality works
* 12 tests, all passing
* Could pull out some longer bits of code to their own methods to help with readability an organization.
* FILE io stuff could be pulled out to own module or class.


#### Black Thursday

* [GitHub URL](git@github.com:Claudia108/black_thursday.git)

## Community

### Feedback to Me

Aside from the required feedback for short pairing sessions with peers my colleagues and I gave each other writeen feedback during the partner projects - one at the beginning and another one towards the end of the project. This helped to identify what worked well and what could be improved. We could focus on those areas of improvement during the project time.

### Posse Challenges

We met on most mornings throughout the module to work on the posse challenges. Towards the end of the module most of my posse members were busy with their own projects and didn't have much surplus to meet. Going into the next module I am planning to reach out more to my posse member to see if we can meet outside of school to get to know each other better. I hope this will help to get us more connected and be able to tap more into the resources of the group.
