## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into the first module I had three main goals. Without having any programing I first of all wanted to find out if I actually like to program and am capable and interested in understanding the concepts of programing languages. The second goal was to check out the community of programer and find out if feel I can thrive in that environment. Thirdly I wanted to really understand the concepts of Ruby and learn how to effectively use its rich library to create programs using its rich library of options. At the end of module 1 I am very happy about the choice I made. I really enjoy programing and feel very much a part of this community already. I am still in progress reaching my third goal and realize it will probably take quite some time of practise to fully getting there. I am satisfied with my progress so far though.

* Collaboration: 

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an
absence on Friday, May 3d.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Junglebeats Linked List

* [GitHub URL](git@github.com:Claudia108/jungle-beats.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

In this three-day project I implemented a linked list with recursion. It was
evaluated by Tess with the following results:

* Ruby Syntax: 3
* Decomposition: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3

#### Nightwriter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/claudia108/nightwriter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/night_writer.markdown)

In this one-week project I implemented a en- and decripting method that coud read and write to files. It was
evaluated by Tess with the following results:

* Overall Funcionality: 2
* Fundamental Ruby Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 2
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3


## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### Hyde

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/claudia108/hyde)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/source/projects/hyde/index.markdown)

In this four-day project I worked with Mark Miranda. It was
evaluated by Mike with the following results:

* Functional Expectations: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Enumerable & Collections: 3
* Code Sanitation: 4

Notes from Mike: 
* all expected functionality works
* 12 tests, all passing
* Could pull out some longer bits of code to their own methods to help with readability an organization.
* FILE io stuff could be pulled out to own module or class.

### Feedback to Me

During my partner projects my colleague and I gave each other writeen feedback after the first day of collaboration and towards the end of the project. This helped to identify what worked well and what could be improved. We could focus on those areas of improvement during the project time.


In the previous module feedback from my peers encouraged me to ask for help
more frequently rather than get stuck and stay there. This module I set a timer
when I ran into a problem and, if I got to 20 minutes without progress, I'd ask
for help. My feedback this module showed improvement and teammates said I'm a
better collaborator.
