## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

Coming into this module I felt weak on JavaScript. I used Exercism three times
per week, read the "Eloquent JavaScript" book, and tried to apply these concepts
in my individual and team projects. In the end I feel much more comfortable with
JavaScript.

### Mid-Module Assessment

* Ruby Syntax: 
* Rails Basics: 
* Javascript Basics: 
* Workflow: 
* Collaboration: 

### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an
absence on Friday, May 3d.

### Feedback to Me

In the previous module feedback from my peers encouraged me to ask for help
more frequently rather than get stuck and stay there. This module I set a timer
when I ran into a problem and, if I got to 20 minutes without progress, I'd ask
for help. My feedback this module showed improvement and teammates said I'm a
better collaborator.
