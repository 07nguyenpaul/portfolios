# Alex Tideman - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I was really excited about the Individual project going intothis module and to dig deeper in the more complex feature of Rails as well as JSON and APIs. 
I also was interested in starting to grasp Javascript/AJAX/JQuery and I spent a lot of individual time practicing it this module.


### Attendance

This module I attended all days and classes on-time with the exception of an
absence on Friday, September 4th and Friday, August 7th.

### Work

I completed the following individual work this module:

#### Effortful 

GitHub: http://www.github.com/Alex-Tideman/effortful
Production: https://be-effortful.herokuapp.com



#### Rales Engine

GitHub: http://www.github.com/Alex-Tideman/rales_engine

Rale Engine was a recreation of Sales Engine, but in Rails and we had to create JSON endpoints for API consumption. I think I did an exceptional job
on this project by utilizing a lot of ActiveRecord queries and almost no ruby methods. I tested it very well and was confident in the data I was producing and it's format.

Feedback: Great looking code. 100% test coverage. 100% complete. Only 1 ruby method in queries.

  * Completion: 4: Project completes all base requirements according to the spec harness.
  * Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%) and tests at the controller and unit levels.
  * Code Quality: 4: Project demonstrates exceptionally well factored code.
  * API Design: 4: Project exemplifies API design idioms, with consistent and coherent response structures, serializers to format JSON data, and effective request format handling.
  * Queries: 4: Project makes great use of ActiveRecord relationships and queries, including some advanced query functionality such as joins and includes.


#### APICurious

In this week-long individual project, I consumed API data from Instagram and used Omniauth to create a new
experience for Instagram users. I delivered 2 extensions and had thorough test coverage.
It was evaluated by Jorge with the following results:

GitHub: http://github.com/alex-tideman/flashbulb
Production: https://flashbulbz.herokuapp.com

  * Completion: 4: Developer delivered all planned features plus 2 extensions.
  * Organization: 4: Developer used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
  * Test-Driven Development: 4: Project demonstrates high test coverage (>90%), tests at the feature and unit levels, and does not rely on external * services.
  * Code Quality: 3: Project demonstrates solid code quality and MVC principles.
  * User Experience: 4: The application is a logical and easy to use implementation of the target application.



## Team

### Projects

I participated in the following team projects:

#### The Pivot

In this two-week long project my team pivoted an existing Rails app to create a auction-based e-commerce site.
We were the only group to integrate background works with both email and Twilio to update users on auction results.
It was evaluated by Jorge with the following results:

GitHub: http://github.com/MaxMillington/the_pivot
Production: http://collectors-world.herokuapp.com

  * Completion: 3: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client.
  * Organization: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
  * Test-Driven Development: 4: Code coverage was fine in SimpleCov, there were clearly tests that didn't actually excercise the edge cases. It's an iffy 4, but I do still feel like they understand the concepts expected.
  * Code Quality: 3: Emails being sent from user model, models too fat overall, controllers has more logic than I would have liked. Overall quality was pretty good, but I wouldn't call it exceptionally well factored.
  * User Experience: 3: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.

### Feedback to Me



## Community

* I try to help whenever I can with coding problems, especially with 1505. I would like to be more involved in Community Outreach next module.

### Giving Feedback

* Gave feedback to all members of TrafficSpy group
* Gave feedback to all members of Endangerous Outfitters group

### Playing a Part

* On Friday, July 17, I delivered a lightning talk "Bolide Detection Systems"
* Every morning I assisted with my Posse mates on the warmup problems
* On the week of July 20th, I paired with 1507 groups on their Linked List project
