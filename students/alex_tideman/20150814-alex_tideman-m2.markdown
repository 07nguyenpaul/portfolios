### Feedback to Me

In the previous module feedback from my peers encouraged me to ask for help
more frequently rather than get stuck and stay there. This module I set a timer
when I ran into a problem and, if I got to 20 minutes without progress, I'd ask
for help. My feedback this module showed improvement and teammates said I'm a
better collaborator.
