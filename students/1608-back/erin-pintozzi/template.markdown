## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Sorting Suite

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/sorting_suite)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/67df787e17e66bb446af2e10c4c6e72b3d41579b/source/projects/sorting_suite.markdown)

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

(description)

*Notes*
* Missing sort method
* Some missing coverage, very strong in other areas (covering edge cases and verifying impact of methods like load)
* TONS of nested if/elsif statements. Would like to see these reorganized
* Solid use of recursion. Nice job!

*Scores*
<br/>

1. Functional Expectations - 2: Application is missing one base expectation

2. Test-Driven Development - 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient

3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components - 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

4. Fundamental Ruby & Style - 2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

5. Looping or Recursion - 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques


#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/event_reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

(description)

*Notes*
* 32 tests, 59 assertions, 0 failures, 92% coverage
* good separation of responsibilities among classes and modules
* repl could use a little extraction of code for double nested if statements

*Scores*
<br/>

1. Functional Expectations - 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

2. REPL Interface - 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

3. Test-Driven Development - 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

4. Breaking Logic into Components - 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

5. Fundamental Ruby & Style - 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

6. Enumerable & Collections - 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques

7. HTML and Style - 4: Usses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/enigma-1)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

(description)

*Notes*
* 13 tests, all passing
* A bit of overuse of instance variables, think about methods sending messages
* Enigma is doing a lot, break out functionality to perhaps a rotator class.
* Some very long methods.
* Enigma class does way too much.

*Scores*
<br/>

1. Overall Functionality - 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

2. Fundamental Ruby & Style - 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

3. Test-Driven Development - 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

4. Breaking Logic into Components - 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
