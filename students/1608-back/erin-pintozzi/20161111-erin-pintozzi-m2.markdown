# Erin Pintozzi - Module 2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

This module, I had two primary goals, both with the overarching goal of passing Module 2 in preparation for a career as a software developer:

#### Goal 1 - Be a “Yes (Wo)man”
Continuation of Mod 1 goal: The purpose of this goal is to encourage myself to do things outside of my comfort zone that I might normally say “no” to doing. This goal will help me be a better student, peer, and person both in and out of the classroom. I will do at least 1 thing outside of my comfort zone each week such as attending a meetup, giving a talk, joining a group, or similar. If 1 opportunity is not available, I will introduce myself to at least one new person or write a blog post as a substitute event.

#### Goal 2 - Work on leadership/support skills
The purpose of this goal is to build my leadership and support skills within the Turing network to be a better student/peer as well as to hone my professional skills. I will earn at least 3 “points” per week. Points can be earned by: participating in class in a meaningful way, meeting someone new, being a pair for another student, meeting with a mentor, volunteering in the greater community (ex: at a meetup), and asking for or offering help. This list may be updated over time as I become aware of different opportunities.
