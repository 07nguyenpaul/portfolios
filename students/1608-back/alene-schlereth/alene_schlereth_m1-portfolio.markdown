# Ali Schlereth - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Before coming to Turing, I taught in the primary grades at a number of schools.
After discovering the level of creativity, puzzle logic, and organization in
writing code, I became passionate about combining these interests so as to
impact the educational technology sector and have fun doing it!

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)


## B: Individual Work & Projects

Projects this module focused on the fundamentals of Ruby with additional emphasis
on Test-Driven_Development, Agile work flow, and working with peers.

#### Date_Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/date_night)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

Date_Night utilizes a Binary Search Tree, where each movie is given a score, stored as a Node. Further functionality 
is added as analysis layers.

* TDD implemented and used effectively  
* Solid test coverage  
* Reflects sound understanding of principles (SRP, BST)  
* Syntax- and style-wise: some small refactoring needed, some long methods  

3: Application fulfills all base expectations  
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality  
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring  
3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques 

#### Event_Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/alischlereth/event_reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

Event_Reporter focuses on consuming a CSV, cleaning the data, and storing information in an accessible ways. This program is run though a REPL and has the ability to print to the command line, create new CSVs, and create HTML documents.

* 39 tests, tests all pass, however, the REPL starts in the testing.
* All functionality works. No extensions done.
* FILE IO should be in a separate class
* Used ERB.
* HTML Looks good. There is a table.
* Some classes do a bit much
* Don't print in the help file, puts at the outer most layer
* Think about what can be pulled out of a class in terms of functionality.
* Really liked how there was an attendee class. 

3: Application fulfills all base expectations
3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use  
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests  
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring  
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of several Enumerable techniques  
3: HTML is valid and has all correct data.  

## C: Group Work & Projects


#### Complete_Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/vidoseaver/complete_me)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/complete_me.markdown)

Complete_Me examines the use of a trie, where an auto complete tool is built. Each letter is a Node with multiple branches of child nodes. In addition, there are analysis tools built in to impact the return result from selecting a word from the suggested options. 

* Base expectations complete plus 1 extension
* Solid testing suite with unit and integrations tests
* Intentional division of responsibilities between classes AND methods; demonstrates thoughtful design and sound       implementation of that design
* Ruby style: some small issues that held project back from "demonstrates excellent knowledge of" style, but overall relatively clean and stylistically consistent project. Nice job!
* Only had use for two enumerables, chosen appropriately. Project's execution doesn't lend itself to a 4 in this category.
* Only bug: count continues to increment with duplicate words. Does not affect trie structure.

4: Application fulfills all base expectations and one extension  
4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data  
4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring  
3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Getting Better at Difficult Things

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/getting_better_at_difficult_things.markdown)

This session was a great discussion. Our group talked a lot about how to celebrate the little successes and not get beaten back by the regular day to day struggle. Much of this inspired by Ta-Nehisi Coates' article. 

#### There is an "I" in "Team"

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/there_is_an_i_in_team.markdown)

Here we watched a video about setting boundaries and creating a dynamic within a group which is supportive of everyone's voice. We discussed experiences in our lives which had lead to successful team dynamics. 

#### Debugging the Gender Gap
