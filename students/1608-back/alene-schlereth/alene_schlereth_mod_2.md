#### Job-Tracker

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/AliSchlereth/job-tracker
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker)

This project focuses on creating tables utilizing different data types and foreign keys, creating routes, utilizing MVC with restful routes and CRUD functionality. In addition, this project practices ActiveRecord managing relationships and queries to the database.

4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.  
3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.  
3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.  
3: ActiveRecord methods are used appropriately in the database, but some Ruby enumerables may also be used. The developer uses ActiveRecord relationships appropriately, and does not call on other classes in their models.  
3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.  
3: The application has been styled, but the user may need to use the nav-bar to enter a URL or back button to get to access some functionality.  
3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features

#### Rush Hour

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/AliSchlereth/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

This project uses Ruby, Sinatra, and ActiveRecord to build a web traffic tracking and analysis tool similar to a Google Analytics. A relational (Postgres) database is created where clients have payloads of information, accessible through a web based user interface.  

(None submitted)

3: Application fulfills base expectations  
3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests  
3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP  
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring  
4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.  
4: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers. 
3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.  

Feedback From Mike:  
Ali was a great teammate.  She was completely dedicated to the success of the project. She was open to discussing ideas, had a large contribution, and was willing to take on tasks as needed.  Specifically, she kept us organized and took on the waffle cards when they had fallen to the wayside.  Dicsussing ideas with her was easy, as she learns quickly and is unafraid to challenge new ideas.  One opportunity (that I think will come with time/comfort with the material) would be to split more work in order to struggle with the some of the problems we encountered.  

Feedback From Nick:  
Ali was a great teammate and excellent communicator. She is open with feedback and provides effective and accurate critical evaluation of both the project and her teammates. Disagreeing with Ali on certain aspects of the project was a pleasure. She was easy to talk to and always constructive. The best feedback I could give Ali would be to be aware of the time spent on what may be trivial issues in regard to the scope of the project. It was a pleasure working with Ali throughout the project and I would recommend her as a teammate to anyone.

## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### Resilience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

(takeaways from session)

#### (Vote Your Conscience)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

In this session we read about and discussed the rights and responsibilities as a citizen followed by reading, reflection, and discussion about voting and political leadership. The general consensus of the group was that many young adults are frustrated by the current functioning of the political system, but that we need to participate in the system in order to make it better.  

#### (Introversion and Extroversion in Teams)

* [GitHub URL]https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

(takeaways from session)
We had a great discussion about the virtures of introversion and extroversion. I enjoyed talking with my group mates about our experiences. Many of us fell in the same space of seeming extroverted but feeling more introverted. Some of our time was spent discussion how this impacts our time at Turing, especially in group works. One of personal revelations was about who teams of three are much easier than partners since you always have to engage when in a partnership but in a trio there is a chance for one person to pull back and be quiet.  

### Professional Development Workshops

(takeaways from session)  

#### (Finding Opportunities w/ Lia)

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/finding_opportunities.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

Lia walked us through some strategies relating to making connections and building our professional network. Some of my top take aways were:  
* on utilizing Meetup attendence lists in conjunction with LinkedIn to find people 
* looking at the current and past jobs of someone on LinkedIn to determine if they have similar work interests as well as broadening my knowledge of the possible companies I'd like to work with  
* ideas what to talk to someone about during a networking coffee meeting 

#### (Collaborative Communication w/ Allison)

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/collaborative-communication.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables]()

This session we talked about how to address someone when they've made significant mistakes and how to share responsibility within a team setting.  During our group discussion, we reviewed the goals and pathways to collaborative group work with respectul communication and mutual accountability. 

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

(feedback from me)

### Being a Community Member

(feedback to me)

### Playing a Part

Pahlka Posse:    
* Posse Leader
As a posse leader I facilitated time management of meetings and utilized structure to involve both ongoing Pahlka members as well as weekly drop in visitors on Fridays.  
We made forward progress building a game with nested games inside of it.   
* My favorite part   
This module I was able to work with a group refactoring JavaScript, explore Node.js and gain some experience with WebPack. I've really enjoyed transferring my knowledge of Ruby to JS.  
* Personal Growth  
As a member of a posse, I have grown in two main areas.
1. Managing group dynamics between peers. Finding the balance between efficiency and dynamic discussion.
1. Diving into a new language and new frameworks. I'm loving learning new tech skills!
