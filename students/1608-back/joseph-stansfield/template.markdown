## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JStans12/binary_search)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

##### Evaluation notes:
- good test coverage overall, needs a node test for basic data and maybe a way to call the title on the node
- full functionality including all extensions
- good consistent use of recursion
- could use a little bit more breaking methods out of nested if statements

##### Evaluation scores:
1. Functional Expectations
  - 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions
2. Test-Driven Development
  - 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  - 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
 - 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
5. Looping or Recursion
 - 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques
