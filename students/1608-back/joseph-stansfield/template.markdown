## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### Date Night

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JStans12/binary_search)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/date_night.markdown)

##### Evaluation notes:
- good test coverage overall, needs a node test for basic data and maybe a way to call the title on the node
- full functionality including all extensions
- good consistent use of recursion
- could use a little bit more breaking methods out of nested if statements

##### Evaluation scores:
1. Functional Expectations
  - 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions
2. Test-Driven Development
  - 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
  - 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
 - 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
5. Looping or Recursion
 - 4: Application makes excellent use of loop/recursion techniques

#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/JStans12/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

##### Evaluation Notes
- 39 tests, 59 assertions, 0 failures, 85.42% coverage
- Used an array of hashes in the repository vs. an attendee or person model, but functions well without. understands the need for a separate model regarding scale of projects and programs in the future
- Extremely clean code, nice separation of responsibilities among classes/modules

##### Evaluaiton Scores
1. Functional Expectations
  - 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions, or a custom extension to be approved by an instructor.
2. REPL Interface
  - 4: Application's REPL goes above and beyond expectations to improve the interface
3. Test-Driven Development
  - 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
4. Breaking Logic into Components
  - 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components such that individual pieces could be reused or replaced without difficulty
5. Fundamental Ruby & Style
  - 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
6. Enumerable & Collections
  - 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
7. HTML and Style
  - 4: Usses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.
