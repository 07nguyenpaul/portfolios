# Megan Talbot - M2 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals at the beginning of this mod were to learn more about the fundamentals of web applications; be able to build a web application  on my own; understand what happens when someone visits a website; improve my use of keyboard shortcuts; and build a broader foundation of HTML/CSS capabilities.  <br>
I am happy to say that I have accomplished all of those goals.  I am very pleased with all of my projects from this module. I hope to continue to work on each of them to be able to use them on my resume. It's almost hard to believe that I learned all of these things in 6 weeks, and how little I knew coming into Mod 2!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker)

Job Tracker was a project which focused on creating an application to track job leads for a someone. This was an individual project, and I was tasked with using migrations to make tables with appropriate relationships, using Active Records for database queries, setting the appropriate routes, using controllers to create CRUD functionality, and setting up my views following best practices. <br>

I enjoyed this project quite a bit and was happy to see my progress in such a tangible way. The new "analysis" section was more challenging that what I had created in the past, but I was happy to be able to complete that section as well.  I have also focused on refactoring this project a bit, and plan to continue to do so over my intermission week.

__Evaluation Scores:__<br>
  4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.<br>
  3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.<br>
  3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.<br>
  4: ActiveRecord methods are used in models to supply all appropriate functionality. Methods exist on the appropriate model, and developers are not referencing other classes or self in models unnecessarily. Ruby enumerables are not used where ActiveRecord methods could provide the necessary functionality. The developer can explain the ActiveRecord methods they used and the relationships between ActiveRecord models.<br>
  3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.<br>
  4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.<br>
  3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features<br>


#### Rails Mini Project 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/gif-generator)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

This was another individual project in which we were able to choose which project we wanted to work on. I chose the "gif generator" where a user can login, browse gifs, and favorite their own. There is also admin functionality, in which an admin can generate gifs. This project was a lot of fun for me, and I also plan to work on it a bit more in intermission week as well, even though it was not scored.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

This module had included two main group projects.  The first, rush hour, was 

#### (Rush Hour)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfpepper/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour was a project to build a tool to track and analyze web traffic. It was a 3 person team project, and as a group we accepted data through what we called a payload, analyzed it, and then displayed the results on a website.

#### (Little Shop)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/epintozzi/root_and_branch)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

Little Shop was a project in which we built an online ecommerce website. Our project was called Root & Branch, and we created an etsy-like platform which sold socially conscious goods.

## D: Professional Skills

I really enjoyed the professional skills sessions this module. We had 3 interesting gear ups, and we had some useful sessions with the Lia and Meg. I may be in the minority within my cohort, but I really like beginning the job-hunting aspect of Turing. 

### Gear Up

#### Vote Your Conscience

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown)

In this gear up, we focused on the idea of voting as a responsibility of citizenship. We had lots of reading, refelection, and a fair amount of discussion time. We got to choose from a couple different topics, and I selected the topic of whether or not one should vote in America. My group had varying ideas about this topic, but we were all able to express those ideas. Many people felt disillusioned with the political process, particularly at a national level.  We did all agree, however, that local elections are vastly impactful and important. 


#### Introversion and Extroversion on Teams

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/introversion.markdown)

This session was about different personality traits, particularly extroversion vs introversion, and how they should be handled best in team environments. I enjoyed that this gear up was conducted in our cohorts, especially since those are the people who make up the teams that I work with while at Turing. I tend to identify as both an introvert and an extrovert, so I often see this issue from both sides. In my discussion group, we all agreed that we could focus more on allowing individual work in teams for introverts. Ultimately, I think the most important thing is to be aware that other people may have a different preference for working styles. 



#### Resilience 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/resilience.markdown)

The final gear up of this mod focused on the idea of resilience, and how that can be beneficial for us going forward. I tend to think of myself as resilient, but I think it's important that everything is relative to an individual. I liked the articles on this topic, in that they discussed what makes someone resilient. It seems that it often comes down to perspective. One thing we talked about in my group was the idea that it's important to try to be resilient yourself, but it's dangerous territory to tell someone else to be more resilient, because that could easily turn toward victim-blaming. In general, resilence is a great trait, and I think it's something that I will continue to try to practice as I go forward in an undoubtedly difficult career.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

### Being a Community Member

### Playing a Part

I was happy to be able to continue my involvement with the Student Advisory Board this module. I really enjoyed being part of SAB and will sad to leave next mod!  SAB duties generally consisted of attending weekly meetings, bi-weekly staff retro meetings, gathering student community feedback, sharing this feedback with the rest of SAB, leading weekly retros, and communicating student facilities requests with proper staff.  I really enjoyed our weekly retro time, and thought Jon and I did a great job of leading these sessions. Addditionally, I helped to plan the Glow in the Gardens event, as well as helping set up our food/clothing drive over the course of this module. I'm happy to say that the Glow in the Gardens was a success, and I hope that we are able to collect a solid amount of canned food and warm clothes to help out the greater Denver community during these winter months.<br>
<br> 
Additionally, I was also active in Joan Clarke society, attending every weekly coffee meeting this mod. I also paired with Mod 1 students 7 different times, which was hopefully at least a little bit as helpful for them as it was for me! <br>
<br>
And lastly, I was involved with the Bezos posse, attending weekly lunch meetings and spike sessions. I have already had discussion with the current Bezos leaders to take over that role in Mod 4. In addition, I arranged for Bezos to have a meeting with the CEO of GoSpotCheck at his office. (Note: he does happen to be my brother ;), but was hopefully a very informative session!)
