## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Job Tracker

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/job-tracker)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/case-eee/job-tracker)

Job Tracker was a project which focused on creating an application to track job leads for a someone. This was an individual project, and I was tasked with using migrations to make tables with appropriate relationships, using Active Records for database queries, setting the appropriate routes, using controllers to create CRUD functionality, and setting up my views following best practices. <br>

I enjoyed this project quite a bit and was happy to see my progress in such a tangible way. The new "analysis" section was more challenging that what I had created in the past, but I was happy to be able to complete that section as well.  I have also focused on refactoring this project a bit, and plan to continue to do so over my intermission week.

Evaluation Scores:<br>
1: Database, Relationships, and Migrations<br>
  4: The database has appropriate tables and appropriate columns to create relationships between tables. Foreign keys are indexed to increase database performance. Tables and columns are appropriately named.<br>
2) Routes<br>
  3: The developer has routes for all functionality that they provide, but may include routes that are not used in the application.<br>
3) Controllers<br>
  3: Some logic may leak into the controllers that would more appropriately exist in a model/PORO. The developer may pass more instance variables than necessary to the view.<br>
4) ActiveRecord<br>
  4: ActiveRecord methods are used in models to supply all appropriate functionality. Methods exist on the appropriate model, and developers are not referencing other classes or self in models unnecessarily. Ruby enumerables are not used where ActiveRecord methods could provide the necessary functionality. The developer can explain the ActiveRecord methods they used and the relationships between ActiveRecord models.<br>
5) Views<br>
  3: Limited logic that could be moved elsewhere remains in the views and/or controllers and developers are able to identify potentially opportunities to refactor.<br>
6) User Experience<br>
  4: The application has been styled and the user can easily navigate between different portions of the application without manually entering the URL into the nav-bar or using the back button on their browser.<br>
7) Testing<br>
  3: Project has a running test suite that tests and multiple levels but fails to cover some features<br>


#### Rails Mini Project 

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/gif-generator)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/rails-mini-project.markdown)

This was another individual project in which we were able to choose which project we wanted to work on. I chose the "gif generator" where a user can login, browse gifs, and favorite their own. There is also admin functionality, in which an admin can generate gifs. This project was a lot of fun for me, and I also plan to work on it a bit more in intermission week as well, even though it was not scored.

## C: Group Work & Projects

This module had included two main group projects.  The first, rush hour, was 

#### (Rush Hour)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bfpepper/rush-hour)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/rush_hour.md)

Rush Hour was a project to build a tool to track and analyze web traffic. It was a 3 person team project, and as a group we accepted data through what we called a payload, analyzed it, and then displayed the results on a website.

### Playing a Part

I was happy to be able to continue my involvement with the Student Advisory Board this module. I really enjoyed being part of SAB and will sad to leave next mod!  SAB duties generally consisted of attending weekly meetings, bi-weekly staff retro meetings, gathering student community feedback, sharing this feedback with the rest of SAB, leading weekly retros, and communicating student facilities requests with proper staff.  I really enjoyed our weekly retro time, and thought Jon and I did a great job of leading these sessions. Addditionally, I helped to plan the Glow in the Gardens event, as well as helping set up our food/clothing drive over the course of this module. I'm happy to say that the Glow in the Gardens was a success, and I hope that we are able to collect a solid amount of canned food and warm clothes to help out the greater Denver community during these winter months.<br>
<br> pairing<br>
I was also active in Joan Clarke society, attending every weekly coffee meeting this mod. <br>
And lastly, I was involved with the Bezos posse, attending weekly lunch meetings and spike sessions. In addition, I arranged for Bezos to have a meeting with the CEO of GoSpotCheck at his office. Note, he does happen to be my brother ;), but was hopefully a very informative session!
