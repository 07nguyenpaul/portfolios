## A: End of Module Assessment

#### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 3: Developer is able to write Ruby with some debugging of fundamental concepts

#### 2. Completion and Progress

* 3: Developer completes baseline assignment and makes meaningful progress toward one of the Challenge options.

#### 3. Testing

* 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification

#### 4. Workflow

* 4: Developer is a master of their tools, efficiently moving between phases of development

#### 5. Collaboration

* 4: Developer actively seeks collaboration both before implementing, while in motion, and when stuck

#### 6. Enumerable & Collections

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

(description)

* Solid testing, would like to have seen it go further in depth, and some additional edge case testing.
* Used iterative approach.
* All iterations complete.
* Code separated well.


#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Looping *or* Recursion

* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques




#### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment]()

(description)

* 32 tests, 48 assertions
* good separation of logic
* uses a hash to store info, but understands the need for a model


#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations


#### 2. REPL Interface

* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

#### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests


#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage


#### 5. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring


#### 6. Enumerable & Collections

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods


#### 7. HTML and Style

* 4: Usses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.





### C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

(Intro)

#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

(description)

* 13 tests, all passing
* A bit of overuse of instance variables, think about methods sending messages
* Enigma is doing a lot, break out functionality to perhaps a rotator class.
* Some very long methods.
* Enigma class does way too much.

#### 1. Overall Functionality

* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

#### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

#### 3. Test-Driven Development

* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components

* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
