# Megan Talbot - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

Coming from a non-progamming background, I hoped to come into this Module and gain a basic understanding of the fundamentals of ruby and object-oriented programming. I am happy to say that (even though it was incredibly challenging!), I believe I was able to accomplish that goal. Looking back at my projects from the entire module, I am pleased to see my progression. I know I have tons more to learn but I am thankful for everything that I have done so far!

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

### Jungle Beats

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/jungle_beat.markdown)

Jungle Beats used the logic of a linked list to build a drum sound-making program from our terminal.

* Solid testing, would like to have seen it go further in depth, and some additional edge case testing.
* Used iterative approach.
* All iterations complete.
* Code separated well.


#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

#### 2. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components
* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 5. Looping *or* Recursion
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques




### Event Reporter

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/event-reporter)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/event_reporter.markdown)

Event Reporter is a project that focued on working with csv files, cleaning data, and running a program with an interactive REPL.

* 32 tests, 48 assertions
* good separation of logic
* uses a hash to store info, but understands the need for a model


#### 1. Functional Expectations
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

#### 2. REPL Interface
* 3: Application's REPL is clear and pleasant to use

#### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage

#### 5. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring

#### 6. Enumerable & Collections
* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods

#### 7. HTML and Style
* 4: Usses CSS and is aesthetically pleasing, using of images, colors and metadata.




### C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects



#### Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/meganft/enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

Enigma was our first paired project, in which we had to encrypt a file, decrypt it, and then crack a message without a key as well.

* 13 tests, all passing
* A bit of overuse of instance variables, think about methods sending messages
* Enigma is doing a lot, break out functionality to perhaps a rotator class.
* Some very long methods.
* Enigma class does way too much.

#### 1. Overall Functionality
* 4: Application follows the complete spec and one extension

#### 2. Fundamental Ruby & Style
* 3:  Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

#### 3. Test-Driven Development
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested.

#### 4. Breaking Logic into Components
* 2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility

(feedback to me)




## D: Professional Skills
(Intro)

### Gear Up
#### (Debugging the Gender Gap)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/code_debugging_the_gender_gap.markdown)

I really enjoyed this gear-up and the following discussion. The movie was very effective. I left feeling both encouraged about where the industry is going and disapointed about the persistent issues pertaning to gender in tech. There were parts of it that will stick with me for many years to come.  My favorite new example of why diversity is important is that air bags used to kill people because everyone who created them were white men of similar stature. 
I was also very happy to have an open discussion after (in group 2 - "I've had issues like those in the movie") with other women who have experienced similar issues, as well as men who wanted to hear more about said issues.


### Professional Development Workshops
#### Learning to Pair

* [Workshop URL](https://github.com/turingschool/professional_skills/blob/master/learning-to-pair.md)
* [Link to Completed Deliverables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dp9f0ndeI2N3OzkTNMWbVJafjLAu5mw0thXJHusWois/edit?usp=sharing)

At the beginning of this module, I didn't realize how important learning to pair would be. I also didn't realize how much of my leanring would center upon pairing! This session was helpful in discussing the central protocols for pairing. But it was also helpful for learning how to effectively DTR - "Define the Relationship." At the beginning of this workshop, I wondered if some of the questions would be redundant or unnecessary, but I have learned that this is not the case and it's very important to DTR in every pairing. 


## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Ali has been an incredibly supportive teammate and companion for me throughout all of Mod 1. I'm so happy to have her around for her positive outlook and kind words. We've spent time talking through challenging problems together, and I know I can always go to her when I get it all confused in my head. It's been great getting to know her and I'm thankful to be her classmate. (to Ali Schlereth)

Anna and I connected right away. I was so happy to have her as a companion throughout all of Mod 1. I say she works fast, but it's because she works so hard on everything she does!  At the same time, Anna is super willing to talk through anything with me. A great sounding board and supportive teammate, I'm glad to have Anna around and know she contributes immensely to our cohort. (to Anna Dolan)

Erin was my first partner in a paired project, and I was so happy to work with her. She was very communicative and flexible. She was great at checking in with me to see how I was feeling about our progress. We both could have done more whiteboarding and planning ahead, but we realized that quickly! Overall, Erin was an excellent partner and I was happy to work with her. (to Erin Pintozzi)

### Being a Community Member

Megan has been a joy to work with. She is easy to collaborate with and a hard worker. I've appreciated both her technical and emotional support during these last 6 weeks. I really like how we can talk through an idea and implement it in our own way, then follow through and support each other. (from Ali Schlereth)

Megan was the first person I connected with at Turing, and she has continued to be helpful and kind throughout the module. She is a great collaborator, and we have worked through problems on individual projects together. She is someone I have always been able to be open with on all kinds of topics, and she is a valuable person to have in the cohort. (from Anna Dolan).





### Playing a Part

I was happy to be a SAB member this module, where I represented our cohort on the Student Advisory Board. We were in charge of gathering feedback and monitoring Turing culture within our cohort, and I really enjoyed being a part of it.  I also joined the Bezos posse, where I participated in weekly posse meetings focuing on entrepreneurship.
