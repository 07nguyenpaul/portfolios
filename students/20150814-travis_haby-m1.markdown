# Travis Haby - M1 - Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

During this module I set out to gain a foothold in the world of programming,
and take in as much information and as many skills as I could over these
6 weeks. Fundamentals of coding in object-oriented ruby and learning workflow
tools like git, github and waffle were the things I focused on the most.

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Attendance

I missed the first Friday of week one intentionally because I had to attend
a good friend's wedding in Maine. I unintentionally had to miss the following
Monday as well due to travel delays caused by storms at the airport I was
connecting through. I also missed one hour on Friday, August 7th, because I
had to leave early for the airport to attend another friend's pre-wedding
activities as a groomsman. People need to seriously chill out with all this
marriage business.

### Work

I completed the following work this module:

#### Chisel

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/travishaby/chisel)
* [Original Assignment](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/chisel.html)

This was our first project. We created a parser that took markdown and
translated it into HTML.

##### Notes

* Program Works
* No extensions
* Some refactoring for clearity
* needs File IO class
* things in fileio.rb should be in chisel.rb

##### Scores

* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Functionality: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/travishaby/linkedlist.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges/blob/master/linked_lists.markdown)

This was our second project where we built the functionality of an array
by creating a linked list of nodes.

##### Notes

* Saw some logic broken out into separate methods.
* Could use some better naming.
* Had recursive and iterative

##### Scores

* Functional Expectations: 4
* Test-Driven Development: 4
* Encapsulation: 4
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3.5
* Looping / Recursion: 4

## Team

### Projects

These are the projects I completed with other students as a team.

#### Engima

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/travishaby/enigma.git)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

This project created Alan Turing's famous enigma machine but in code.

##### Notes

* started with a pretty tangled web, restarted, realized there'd be some dependencies
and tangles
* Had encrypt and decrypt done by Sunday, but then reworked
* Good tests overall, leave some areas to be filled in at the edges
* Implementation is pretty good with a few fragments that are "above your level" -- a little SO help
* Some crafty bits pulled from intro tutorials, but good paying attention
* Need the output messages when we run encrypt/decrypt/crack, but functionality
is fine

##### Scores

* Functionality: 3
* Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
* Test-Driven Development: 3
* Breaking Logic into Components: 3

## Community

### Giving Feedback

The feedback app isn't up and running yet, but I completed 100% of surveys to
the best of my ability, and really focused on giving constructive feedback
about instructors so that instruction at Turing can be improved for the benefit
of all of us students.
