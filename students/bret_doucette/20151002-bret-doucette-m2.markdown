# Bret Doucette - M2 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

My initial area of emphasis for this module was improving how I tackeled problems. Part or even a majority of my module one stress was me doubting myself, especially in situations where doubt was not warranted. To combat this I became better at handling difficult sitatuins.

**Feedback to me**

Holzmann - "Bret is very organized and super fun to work with. He was the glue that held our little team together and made sure that we delivered the final product when we needed to. One of Bret’s biggest strengths was being able to figure things out on his own. I could always trust him to figure out how to do something. An area for improvement would be take more breaks."

Pease - "It was impressive watching Bret work during Traffic Spy.  His ability to learn new information on the fly was pretty cool to see.  He was positive and supportive the entire time.  I honestly don’t think I have seen him in a bad mood over the last 2 modules which is really beneficial to the people around him.""
