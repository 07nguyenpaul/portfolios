#### Notes

* Wrote additional tests that covered functionality in the spec.

* Great communication skills.

* Good instincts on testing,

* Definitely let tests drive the development process.

* Used nth child in testing. :thumbs_up:

* We used Ruby to calculate.

* Refactored to remove Ruby and use Activerecord by storing percent_correct in database.

* Then refactored again to use a scope instead of a class method.

### Work

### Individual

#### Blog Posts

* [Live Blog](http://tonirib.github.io/personal-blog/)

__Number of Posts:__ 5

I didn't think I would enjoy blogging about coding (and the first entry wasn't, really) but as I got further into December I realized there were a few topics I actually wanted to write about. I ended out blogging about following the errors while using TDD, going 'behind the scenes' of the web by starting with Sinatra before moving to Rails, switching my shell from bash to fish, and building the SHA-1 Hashing Algorithm.

#### Ruby Challenges

* [Pig Latin & Swift Stats](https://github.com/ToniRib/code_challenges)
* [Event Reporter](https://github.com/ToniRib/event_reporter)

__Total Completed Challenges:__ 3

### Team

The following two projects were the graded team projects for module 2:

#### Traffic Spy

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/ToniRib/traffic-spy)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/traffic_spy.markdown)

Evaluator: Rachel Warbelow

TrafficSpy is an application that works similar to Google Analytics, tracking data for registered applications. The data from this applications is sent to our server using the curl command from the terminal (see below). The user can then view analytical data for a registered application via our website.

No comments were recorded by Rachel.

##### Scores

* __Functional Expectations:__ 4
* __Test-Driven Development:__ 4
* __Encapsulation/Breaking Logic Into Components:__ 3.5
* __Fundamental Ruby & Style:__ 3.5
* __Sinatra / Web and Business Logic:__ 4

#### Little Shop of Orders

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/martensonbj/little_shop)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/little_shop.markdown)

This Rails application is a marketplace for artists. An artist can register an account and add art pieces to sell. Users can register accounts to purchase the available art pieces. An admin can regulate the process by transitioning order status and managing art for artists.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* __To Beth Secor:__ "Beth was a great partner for Traffic Spy. She's a very talented programmer who doesn't mind doing some of the dirty work (like doing 8 migrations in one day!) but is also a very proficient problem solver. When I got stressed on due to an issue on Sunday afternoon before the project was due and had to step away for 30 minutes, Beth stepped in to try to solve the problem without complaint. She's correct in her assessment that I should have listened to her more because her ideas are usually right and I think we sometimes detoured down the wrong path because I pushed too hard for my idea. Overall, I think she did an amazing job for our group and she's always level headed when it comes to handling strong-willed personalities."

* __To Taylor Moore:__ "Taylor is a smart guy who sometimes gets hung up on a problem for a long time before asking for help. We did have some issues in our Little Shop project with Taylor not communicating with the group when he wasn't going to be able to finish a task or even to let us know what he was working on. It wasn't uncommon to have him assign an issue or two to himself then show up the next day without having completed parts of his work and without having told us he wasn't going to be able to complete it. However, I know that he was dealing with personal issues at the time and we talked about these things in person before the project was done and I told him that the best thing he can do in a group project is to communicate early and often if he knows he isn't going to get to something he said he would complete. I think Taylor has the drive and the intelligence to be a great programmer, but he does need to learn to communicate with others better to avoid frustrated team members."

* __To Brenna Martenson:__ "Brenna is a great partner to work with. She is always engaged when the group is working together. She takes on tasks without having to be asked or assigned to them and communicates well to the group what she has completed and what she needs help with. She follows through on her commitments and never complains about taking on more work. She's also AMAZING when it comes to front end coding and styling websites quickly. I would be happy to work with Brenna again on any project!"

### Being a Community Member

* __Beth Secor:__ "I was very excited to finally pair with Toni on a project, because I always learn a lot from her when I work with her. It was great to have her by my side as we battled through our first migrations and ActiveRecord associations. Though is was challenging and confusing, we learned a lot together. The only feedback I have for her is to consider the ideas of her group members more often, I wish she had been more trusting of my ideas on how to set up the database and views."

### Playing a Part

* Started Tuesdays w/Toni where I paired with 2 people for 45 minutes each every Tuesday through the whole module. It mostly ended out being with 1511 students who seemed to really appreciate the extra help.
* Had my husband create and helped hang the large glass Turing logo in the hallway.
* Volunteered on community day to help teach at DSST
* Made coffee, did the dishes, and changed out toilet paper rolls a few times every week
* Participated in some of the computability theory (now machine learning) morning classes with Aaron.
