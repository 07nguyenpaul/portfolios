# Shannon Paige - M3 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
Although I passed mod 3 the first time, I decided to repeat so that I could
strengthen my skills, while having time to explore other areas of development.
My goal for this module is to better understand the ambiguity of API consumption,
and to learn better testing techniques (specifically VCR and rspec).

### Attendance
