# David Stinnette - (M3) Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

My goal for the third module was to take my Ruby and Rails knowledge to a professional level and become comfortable working with APIs and JavaScript. I also wanted to schedule more pairing sessions with other students & alumni.

### Attendance

I attended all class on time during the third module with the exception of certain Thursday and Friday mornings when I had physical therapy appointments for my knee. These were cleared with Josh.

### Work

I completed three individual projects and one team project during the third module.

#### API Curious

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/dastinnette/github_clone)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md#available-apis)

API Curious is the first individual project of module three at Turing. Github Clone is software developer dashboard built using the GitHub API. The project was evaluated by Lovisa Svallingson.

##### Evaluation Comments

Good, working site. Has almost all of the functionality implemented. Nice, well factored code. A lot of instance variables passed from the UsersController#show which could be broken out.

--> In response to this feedback, I implemented a presenter PORO to take responsibility away from the Users Controller.

##### Scores

Scores were not given for this project.

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/rails_engine.md)

Rails Engine is the second individual project in module three at Turing. It's a Rails application that uses ActiveRecord to build a JSON API which exposes the SalesEngine data schema. The project was evaluated by Lovisa Svallingson.

##### Evaluation Comments

All specs passing but 5
80% test coverage, RSpec, controller/models/relationships
Routes file could need better organization

##### Scores

* Completion: 3
* Test Driven Development: 4
* Code Quality: 4
* API Design: 3
* Queries: 3

#### Politweets

* [Heroku](https://politweets-app.herokuapp.com/)

* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/self_directed_project.md)

Politweets is the third and final individual project in module three at Turing. It's a Rails application that uses Twitter's oauth and REST API to pull tweets by hashtag, the geocoder gem to normalize/sanitize a tweet's location, and interactive javascript maps to display the data.

##### Evaluation Comments

## Team

#### The Pivot

* [Heroku](https://dreambuilder.herokuapp.com/)
* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/jecrockett/the_pivot)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/the_pivot.md)

The Pivot is the first project in module three at Turing. Each group is given a legacy project to work with and must produce a multitenant rails app. Our group included Jamie Crockett, Steve Oscar, and myself. The project was evaluated by Lovisa Svallingson and Josh Mejia.

##### Evaluation Comments

Technical Notes:
* views: good use of partials
* controllers: Mostly skinny controllers, logic is pushed down the stack and operations are broken out to private methods
* tests: good tests, 90% test coverage, nice patterns

Client Notes: None provided

##### Client Scores

* Completion: 4: Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the client in timely manner.
* Organization: 4: Team used a project management tool and updated their progress in real-time.
* User Experience: 3+: Project exhibits a production-ready user experience.
* Extensions: 3: Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by an almost delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

##### Technical Scores

* Test-Driven Development: 4 - nice use of TDD, good use of patterns in the tests, good separation of responsiblities within each test
* Code Quality: 3.5
* Git Workflow: 3 - more conversation in the PR's

## Community

### Giving Feedback

* I delivered feedback to other students who requested it.

* Feedback for me: "I'd love to hear both positive and constructive feedback on how I'm doing and how I'm supporting our cohort and Turing."
* Super positive - kept the mood light even during trying times!
* Really glad David stuck around to be in this cohort. He is hard working, encouraging, and fun.
* It was a challenge pairing for me, for the first time, and exhausting at times, but I'm also proud of how we were often able to step back when having a disagreement and reset our communication. Even though it was difficult for me, I'd be happy to work with David again.

### Being a Community Member

I attended Protocol weekly, even during the dark times, and encouraged those in my cohort to do the same. I paired with several 1602 students on exercisms and Black Thursday projects. 

### Playing a Part

* Paired with 1602 students ...
* Gave a lightning talk on how to network more confidently and effectively at meetups.
