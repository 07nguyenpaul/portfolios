### Feedback

* from Steve Pentler: Dave is the essence of optimism. Even after he woke up one morning with a completely dysfunctional leg, Dave never complained or made any excuses over the course of the project. He does a great job of providing heat checks and keeping the MVP as the number one priority. He has an acute sense for when it’s time to step away, alter the approach, or ask for help, which is something I struggle with.
___

### Giving Feedback

* to Steve Pentler: Steve is the man. He’s got a ridiculous work ethic, communicates well, and tackles problem solving with an easy to understand and logical approach. While I kept preaching caution and completing the MVP first, he was good about encouraging us to push through the MVP so we had time to tackle some interesting extensions. It was a pleasure to pair with Steve during our Gametime project.
