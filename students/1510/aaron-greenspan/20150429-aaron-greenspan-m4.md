### Projects

Below is a list of all of my projects and assessment scores from Module 4.  

#### GameTime

**Hand rendered 3D engine and original space flight sim. 

* Assessor: Meeka
* Github: https://github.com/afg419/battlezone    

Notes: 
* Application is fully playable and exceeds the expecations set by instructors
Instructor Feedback
* The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.
* The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

**Scores**
* overall: 175/150

#### Scale Up

**Phoenix API implements ReactJS websockets** Implemented a parallel process for auto-incrementing acounter on the back end and communicated those updates via websockets to users.  Users can manipulate counter.  This project would later iterate into a word descrambling game.

* Assessor: Meeka
* GitHub: https://github.com/afg419/word_scram

Notes:

* Developer has >= 2 blog posts documenting something they have worked on for their independent study or has one in depth blog post.
* Developer participated daily in stand ups with the group (remote or in person). Developer was able to speak to their work in stand ups in a way that was clear and informative. Developer was involved in pull request reviews.
*  Developers pushed themselves and their team by taking risks which is demonstrated by a delivered feature. Developers explored concepts and technologies outside the scope of the curriculum.

**Scores**
* 150/150

#### Real Time

**Master websockets for group communication** This project continued the previous by building out a fully formed word descrambling game on the Phoenix/ReactJS groundwork of Scale Up.  Users get authorized on the back end, and can join an alternating in-game/out-of-game loop.  While in-game, an identical collection of randomly generated letters is sent to all players, where they race to form the largest number of words.

### Giving Feedback

>**Dan Winter:**

>**Karina Gonzalez:**

>"I’ve paired a number of times with Karina on her past two projects.  She’s equal parts curious, excited, and (highly) capable.  She also brings a light-heartedness to her work which makes it a blast to code with her and easy to code well.  I have never once heard Karina ask for clarification on a concept, plan, or code implementation.  This is certainly a testament to her uncanny ability to grasp a thing quickly.  But, I also wonder if Karina is hesitant to ask a big question and admit that something just isn’t making sense.  If I’m right on this, I hope Karina comes to realize that those questions don’t at all make her appear any less competent, but instead achieve the opposite. Such questions will both speed her own progress and, most importantly, allow her colleagues to more readily benefit from her unique thought process and viewpoint."

>**Brant:**

>"I’m going 4 mods deep on Brant feedback here.  Let’s recap the main points from the previous three: I like Brant; Brant should trust in his abilities more; Brant is really supportive of others in our cohort.  New stuff: I like Brant more; Brant is more trusting in his abilities; Brant’s become a total pit of dark and brutal disregard for the feelings of others and has led to ashen tears of countless coding colleagues.  Just kidding.  He knows the respect and care I have for him, and here is not the place to put it."

### Being a Community Member

>""-**Brant Wellman**

>"I have yet to be paired with Aaron yet, something I’ve said I was excited for since Module 1. Despite that, Aaron was incredibly helpful to me this module. He pushed me to knock out the rake CSV import task right away for Rails Engine, and then guided my panic regarding charting libraries during the Personal Project. He encouraged me to attempt something perhaps beyond my grasp, and even though I backtracked and went a different avenue, I learned a ton from the experience and got much more familiar with Javascript syntax. He’s also one of the best people to theorize with, and I think much of our module would agree. He’s a great listener and can quickly hypothesize 3-4 solutions to a problem and act as an idea-generator for other students. Beyond all this, Aaron is considerate and emotionally supportive. If something in your program starts working, he’s as excited for you as you are. If “literally all the tests are broken,” he’ll come pair with you or offer to ScreenHero to get you back on track. As I haven’t worked intimately with Aaron on a project yet it’s hard to come up with pointed constructive criticism, but from a cohort-perspective and friend-to-friend perspective, Aaron is an incredible asset for our group an will undoubtedly be an incredible asset wherever he ends up."-**James Crockett**

### Playing a Part

I've participated in the larger Turing Community in the following ways:

* Gave DenverRB beginner track talk.
* Co-led Armstrong Elixir/phoenix posse.
* Helped Module 1 and 3 students with their project.
