# Hector Huertas - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
My wish after Turing was to be a truly excellent well-rounded programmer.

As that wish includes many factors out of my control, and I believe that personal
goals should depend only on oneself, my mission was to fulfill these requirements:

* Extreme dedication.
* Always choosing out of comfort-zone tasks.
* Focus on social, collaborative and community related aspects of programming.

I totally accomplished the mission! I am really proud of my attitude during the whole program and am extremely happy and satisfied with my programming skills. I feel totally ready to conquer the world.

### Attendance

100% attendance while I was in Denver, with a couple of late mornings.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

Marlo Major
* Spending time with Marlo doing whatever is a gift. He is my prototype of the successful person: cool, kind and smart. His mindset is so extraordinary that I don't know what to remark. His awareness of the current state of his life and the goals he wants to achieve allow him to keep making great decisions over and over, leveling up himself and controlling his own destiny. He will achieve whatever he desires. This, of course, includes being a phenomenal programmer. It is super easy to work with him, and I am really grateful he retake mod 4 so I could enjoy doing a project with him (sorry man). For actual programming feedback: before diving into implementing a feature/function/expression, it might be useful to think a little bit more on 'what do i want to do? / what do i need?' from a conceptual point. Being able to explain your idea in plain english without using any technical terms is a good starting point for writing the actual  -*insert language*- implementation.

### Being a Community Member

Armstrong Posse for the win!!!

I have been promoting the Elixir language and functional programming among the Turing students.

* I have been leading the Armstrong posse along with Aaron Greenspan.

* I did student led sessions on Elixir on the two Fridays I was in Denver.

* Last but not least, I have been asking questions and giving my point of view on several JavaScript topics during the lessons, to try to give more presence to functional JavaScript.

Following  my personal crusade, I rescued several abandoned glasses when taking my own to safety.
