# Dan Winter - Module 3 Portfolio


## Individual


### Your Mission

By the end of the module, I'd like to learn the basics of Ember and build an app.
I'd also like to come up with a sweet ass app for my personal project

### Dan's Reflection

This module was a little rough on me in my personal life.
I did not have the time to devote to Ember but I'm pretty happy with my progress in Rails.
On to the wonders of JavaScript next module! (Hopefully)

### End of Module Assessment

#### Notes:

* API: Index/Show/Delete works well
* Search: single and multi word search works well
* Testing is good, the items_controller_spec make assertions about the appropriate data points
* Feature test for the search is very thorough, and there are tests for both single and multi search. The feature test is making assertions about appropriate data
* In the products method in the BestBuyService, the formatting of the longDescription could be split out in a separate method. The results (latter part of method) could also be split out.
* Nice use of POROs for the Product, good use of serializers

#### Scores:

* Ruby Style & Syntax - 3: Developer solves problems with a balance between conciseness and clarity and often extracts logical component
* Rails Syntax & API - 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that follow the principles of MVC, push business logic down the stack, and skillfully utilizes ActiveRecord to model application state. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing
* Rails Style - 4: Developer is able to craft Rails features that make smart use of Ruby, follow the principles of MVC, and push business logic down where it belongs
* Testing - 4: Developer excels at taking small steps and using the tests for both design and verification. All new lines of code are tested.
* Progression/Completion - 4: Developer is able to implement solutions at the speed of a developer.
* Workflow - 4: Developer commits every 15 minutes and has at least 12 commits on the project

### Traffic Spy

Group: Daniel, Steve O, and Brant

Assessed By: Mike

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/danjwinter/traffic-spy-skeleton)


#### Notes

* 64 tests, 106 assertions, all passing.
* No extensions
* cool text entry identifier on front page
* 96.93% test coverage
* generally good testing, didn't test error page
* Some opportunities to refactor, pull things out to other methods.
* Little bit of logic leaking to the view.

#### Score

* Overall Functionality - 3: Application fulfills base expectations
* Test-Driven Development - 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components - 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* Fundamental Ruby & Style - 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* Sinatra / Web and Business Logic - 4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.
* View Layer - 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view

#### Dan's reflection

Traffic Spy was a good starter project for working with a web application. I felt we could have pushed ourselves more but I have also received feedback that I can go too fast and that my enthusiasm for tackling new challenges can seem headstrong. I plan on working on my pacing and working better with my classmates on future projects so that we all get the most out of the experience.

### Giving Feedback

#### Feedback to Brant from Traffic Spy

"Brant is great partner to have on a project because he is focused, knowledgeable and fun to be around. Brant’s determination to do well and learn pushes the rest of the team towards those same goals. At times, it seems like Brant doesn’t speak up because he isn’t 100% sure about something but the reality is, none of us are 100% sure about anything programming related. If he were to voice opinions a bit more and a bit more strongly, it would help his team better clarify their vision."

#### Feedback to Steve from Traffic Spy and Little Shop

"Working with Steve on two projects this module was a great experience. He’s always willing to do whatever the team needs and takes on challenges without needing to be asked. Steve is easy to work with as a pair by thinking critically about the challenge and gets things done quickly when working solo. Not only can he Rails, he can also CSS/Materialize very well. One of the things that I would to have loved was if we paired more on front end shenanigans so that I could learn more of his CSS-Fu ways."

#### Feedback to Beth from Little Shop

"What a project manager! Beth was on it from the beginning and ensured we maintained proper Github workflow, kept up on our waffles and didn’t let anything sneak through the cracks. She helped keep the team focused when dreams of a Stache filled world drew us off task. Beth’s programming skills and analytical mind were a huge asset to the team and she easily caught bugs that made it past our tests."

### Receiving Feedback

#### Feedback from Brant for Traffic Spy

"Dan was a solid Project Manager on our Traffic Spy project. He has good vision of where the project is currently and where it ultimately needs to go. One suggestion for Dan is to be aware of how headstrong he is. He has strong opinions about how he things something can be implemented, and some people may interpret his enthusiasm for his ideas as a lack of flexibility. Dan often solves problems faster than others; being aware of this and helping others to the solution is a great way of continuing to build his already solid leadership skills."

#### Dan's Reflection

Thanks Brant, that’s definitely something I need to work on and I appreciate your candor. I’ll try to concentrate on that next module.

#### Feedback from Beth for Little Shop

"Dan is great to pair with because he is very enthusiastic about project ideas. He thinks of ideas outside the scope of the project and works hard to implement them. I am constantly impressed by the amount of time he puts into exploring things outside of class. Sometimes he got so excited about new ideas that he lost focus on the current feature we were working on, but he told me he was working on this, and as the project went on, he became much more focused."

#### Dan's Reflection

Particularly when I understand things well, I get bored easily and want to move on to more exciting things. I'm working on staying focused, even when things seem mundane. I want to keep on tackling new and interesting challenges but there's a time and a place for that. I need to focus more on working with my classmates to ensure they have the same understanding of concepts before moving on to larger challenges.

#### Feedback from Steve for Traffic Spy and Little Shop

"I was able to work with Dan on both of the big projects this module, and am glad that was the case. He’s among the most intellectually ambitious and curious of our class, and is always pushing to try things in new and interesting ways. His drive to really learn the concepts pushes the whole group to learn more, and he can quickly grasp how all the parts fit together in the big picture. He’s easy to work with, and is very open to suggestions, while being willing to defend his position when warranted."

#### Dan's Reflection

I appreciate Steve's words but after reflecting on feedback from Brant, I worry that I don't always come off as welcome to other approaches and that I move too quickly. Balance will be key moving forward.


### Playing a Part

#### Pairing with Thom

During the first week of the module I had the opportunity to have lunch with Thom. He expressed a lot of anxiety about repeating and I offered to pair with him every Tuesday morning. He immediately took me up on it and although he will be repeating module 1, he is starting to develop better trouble shooting and problem solving skills and has a much healthier attitude towards repeating and how he can take advantage of it rather than face it as a burden.

Feedback from Thom regarding our sessions:
"Dan Winter has been helping me on Tuesday mornings since my second week at Turing. Dan approached me about it while at lunch, so I didn’t even have to ask.
He’s found where I’ve been struggling and than walked me through it. Doing an amazing job of asking pointed questions to make me think, so I can arrive at the answer rather than giving it to me."

#### Spreading Life in the Dungeon

Sunny approached me with an idea early in the module to transform a portion of the basement into a plant haven. I loved the idea and helped execute operation Pinterest Flowerpot Post over the holiday break.
