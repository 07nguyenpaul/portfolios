### Feedback

* "Steve is the hardest guy to give feedback to. His soft skills are so extremely good that there is nothing to say, but his technical skills are very well rounded too, and always improving. The most impressive thing is how he uses those skills to build amazing products. Not apps, or webpages, he builds full-fledged products that customers would love. The only feedback I can give is: don’t fall asleep. Keep improving those technical skills so you are able to give birth to those amazing ideas in your mind. And never stop smiling!" - Hector

* "Steve is one of my favorite people to work with at Turing. We haven't had the opportunity to do an official project, but alongside Brant Wellman he is my go-to person when I need a sounding board or to lighten the mood. We connect in our affinity for front end development, which is rare in a back-end heavy school, and I've found that when pairing we have a very similar workflow. He is one of the most hard working students in the program, and the progress he has made since Module 1 is undeniably impressive. My criticism for Steve is that he is a slow runner. If we could just work on his endurance and speed I would really like him as a person. I am so excited to see where he ends up and secretly hope we end up working at the same place." - Brenna

* "Steve is so easy-going and fun to work with. He is extremely good at front-end design and displaying content in an organized and aesthetic way. He always recognizes whenever I can't reach something in the kitchen and gets it for me without asking, he is an awesome member of the Turing community. - Beth"

* "Steve. Dad. Steve. Whatever you choose to call him, this man of integrity and hard work, he brings a good vibe to the room. And a mullet. A MULLET.  which he wears it handsomely.  He is also forgiving. Why, only last week I didn’t believe his website was his. I thought he had pulled up a professional website and was pulling my leg. In reality, it was a professional website. His professional website.  I’m always impressed by his design work, both on the computer and in his hairstyle. Beyond that, he’s a well-rounded developer and, but brings no ego and is always a pleasure to be around. I’m a bit disappointed we’ve never been assigned to work on a project together.  But also I understand - a Steve sandwich just isn’t fair." - Steve O

* "Steve P is one of the best front end developers that I’ve met during my time here at Turing, without his help and working with him I doubt my front end skills would be where they are today. His dedication to his craft is uncanny. I believe the first day of the project, Hector and I spent the entire afternoon trying to build our basic views, after we were done and did our best, Steve in less than an hour created views based on our design that was far superior. His easy going personality made his teaching infectious and I can honestly say he made me a much stronger developer." - Slota

* "Steve is a great person to have nearby in the Turing environment. He is stable, supportive, thoughtful, and caring. He is a calming force on others (speaking from experience) in an environment that can produce a lot of stress. Steve gets very focused on his work and doesn't take many breaks. I would encourage Steve to try to create a structure where he takes more pomodoros while he is working." - Brant

### Giving Feedback

* It was intimidating to show up to the Zyg posse on the first few days of Turing, because Dan was extremely capable and I was entering the underworld for the first time. But Dan’s generosity and genuine interest in problem solving set the tone immediately, and he carried on this tradition over the remaining seven months. Dan is exceptionally bright. I know that, he knows it, and the community has realized it. But what I really admire is how he has maintained an equal level of respect for students like myself, who will probably never return any programming favors. He’s going to be one of the most successful programmers from our cohort, and I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to bounce countless ideas off of him. I hope he finds himself in a position to create positive social change, because that’s what the world needs. Best of luck and thank you, Dan! Now go crush your interview! - Steve

* “To think that Brant almost took a module off and left 1510 is hard to believe at this point. He’s nearly the heart and soul of the cohort, and has formed some of the strongest relationships with a multitude of people in the cohort. He genuinely cares about everyone in 1510 and is perhaps the most well-liked individual in the group. I really admire how he has reinvented himself as a “yes man.” At first he was a bit closed off to the group and took a very mature approach to Turing. Then he opened up, started singing karaoke, and initiated a chain reaction. The world is much better because of it. I really hope that he is able to locate a job where he is able to connect with nature, as it seems to be a very centering force in his life. I expect that we’ll get in some spectacular hikes and camping over the summer, and I really look forward to it. Finally, I apologize for calling you “old.” You’re actually a very youthful, kind, dirty old bastard. Aside from personal stuff, he is one of my favorite people to pair with. His work ethic is off the charts, and his work flow is smooth. He discontent without understanding and rarely takes shortcuts, which keeps a lot of us in check. We entered module 3 with a pact that we were going to get through it together and not make a lot of noise in the process, and here we are graduating 4. It feels like a very shared accomplishment. Congrats!

* "Feedback for Brenna: “Brenna  cares! She is more approachable and generous with her time than anyone in 1510. At times, I’ve borderline abused her as a sounding board and she continues to respond to my sorry cries for help. And when she helps, her ability to articulate her thought process always impresses me. She is the force that keeps 1510 in balance, but don’t tell her that because she’s too humble to accept compliments. In terms of front-end design, she has almost single-handedly kept 1510’s views afloat. When people have a simple styling question, they consult me. When they have a complex styling question, they know who to talk to. I’m extremely happy that she is sticking around Turing. I have no doubt that she is going to nail the TA position and keep our cohort close and involved.  In terms of constructive feedback, I’m angry about two things. The first is that she is legendary at keeping friends out drinking past their bedtime, which is bad for my health. The second is that she’s so damn old, only because we couldn’t experience the Russell Wilson year at Wisconsin together. Roll Badge."

* "I’ve spent a month of my life with Hector Huertas and I grew to love his catch-phrase “That’s Em-paw-saw-ble.” He is remarkable foresighted  when designing the back end for projects, and his upfront thinking saves a ton of time. Finally, he doesn’t practice his catch-phrase. If you tell him something is impossible, he’ll go out and do it. I have an immense respect for his capabilities, and he was fantastic to work with.

* "Feedback for Steve-O: Steve-O, the king of laid-backness, also happens to be the innovator of 1510. If you watch the group, you’ll notice that he’s generally the one to pioneer a new skill. More importantly, he is overly-generous with his time and is one of the most approachable characters in 1510. I have an immense appreciation for the time he took to patiently help me install VCR for OmniAuth during APIcurious, His Google skills will serve him well in the future, and I mean that seriously. Finally, have you noticed his style? One particular day he wore boots, short denim? shorts, and a cut neck hoodie. The future is Steve, and I am honored to share a namespace with this fine gentleman.
