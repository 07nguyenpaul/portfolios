# Lenny Meyerson - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission
I came to Turing to learn in an immersive environment- to offer single-minded focus to this study for the next seven months. Thus far, the process has been more challenging than I expected but in ways I did not anticipate. Having imagined that my time at Turing would be about learning to program(typing code), I believe I focused to narrowly on this subject at the expense of time that might have been spent learning problem solving skills, learning how to learn in this environment, and learning how and when to both ask for and make use of help.

As I continue in the program these neglected aspects must play a larger role in my studies.

### End of Module Assessment

## Lenny Mod 1 Retake
Assessed By: Horace
Challenge: Multipliers
Result: PASS
Notes:
* Doing better getting over the nerves this time
* Enumerables are quite strong; good grasp of the toolkit
and doing well at bringing those tools to bear on specific problems
* Picking the appropriate one and using it concisely
* Problem-solving / Algo-approach are pretty good -- doing good
at breaking down into an approach
* Keep thinking about naming things in your code -- this will go a long
way to improving readability
1. Ruby Syntax & API
* __3__: Developer is able to comfortably implement solutions in Ruby
2. Ruby Style
* __3__: Developer writes code that is easy to follow
3. Blocks & Enumerations
* __4__: Developer is able to consistently select and implement the best-choice enumerator methods with blocks
4. Testing
* __3__: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks
5. Workflow
* __3__: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts
6. Collaboration
* __3__: Developer lays out their thinking before attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the processs

### Mod 1 Assessment
Assessed By: Jeff
Challenge: Player class
Result: FAIL
Notes:
* Fine start with writing basic tests
* Solid with creating objects across classes
* Good start with implementing solutions
* Typing is ok but feels like it takes too much thinking
* Some troubles when the implementation gets more complicated
* Good approach to writing tests
* Solid progress overall but kind a multi-sided wheel

## Scores

### 1. Ruby Syntax & API

* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

### 2. Ruby Style

* 3: Developer writes code that is easy to follow

### 3. Blocks & Enumerations

* 3: Developer demonstrates understanding of blocks and can effectively use enumerable methods

### 4. Testing

* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

### 5. Workflow

* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

### 6. Collaboration

* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process

Below is a list of all of my projects and assessment scores from Module 1.

#### (Solo Projects)

#### Enigma

Encryption/decryption machine. Emphasis on breaking program into logical components, TDD and enumerable techniques. Required to build a key generator and date offset, encrypt a message using a 4-digit rotation, decrypt the message using a pre-determined key and crack an encrypted message without the key.

Assessed By: Horace

* [Repository:](https://github.com/TheObtuseAutodidact/enigma)

Comments:

Base functionality is all there and seems solid
28 tests; seem to be spread across various objects; probably could use a few more, but overall volume is ok
Lots of opportunities remain to use some more sophisticated enumerables
Watch especially for the map pattern (make empty array, then iteratively push onto the array)
In general we can trim a lot of the methods by relying on enumerables to generate new values rather than having to reassign variables at each step
Some of the methods are getting long and could use some extraction
Watch out for "magic numbers" hanging out -- would like to keep putting semantic names on these
Scores:

Overall Functionality 3
Fundamental Ruby & Style 3
TDD 3
Breaking Logic Into Components 3
Enumerable & Collections 3

#### Jungle Beats
A drum machine that's backed by a linked list.
Assessed By: Mike

* [Repository:](https://github.com/theobtuseautodidact/jungle_beats)

Notes:

23 runs in tests
need separate file for node test
pop does not work
cannot work with strings, just individual data items
overall clean code, good tail method
some opportunities for refactoring, there are some long methods
Scores:

Overall Functionality: 1
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
Test Driven Development: 3
Breaking Logic into Components: 3
Looping and Recursion: 3

## (Team Projects)


* [Repository:](https://github.com/brantwellman/headcount)

Headcount

GitHub URL
Original Assignment
Real-world data collection and analysis. Emphasis on parsing CSV files, extracting data, creating hashes and analyzing that data for specific years, districts and outcomes.

#### http: yeah_you_know_me
Group: Lenny & Alex

Assessed By: Horace

* [Repository:](https://github.com/Salvi6God/http_yeah_you_know_me)

Notes:

Some initial progress on a procedural solution the problem
Struggled to make layered progress on problem components, largely due to difficulties in applying dev processes and techniques
Struggled with outpacing feedback - no tests to provide feedback, seems to have led to difficulty understanding the progress that had been made thus far and the scope of the problem
Scores:

Overall Functionality 1: Application implements two or fewer iterations
Fundamental Ruby & Style 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
Test-Driven Development 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
Breaking Logic into Components 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### Playing a Part

As something of a socially awkward introvert, I have tried to be part of the community in little way.
I've appreciated Fridays' lunch roulette as an opportunity to get to know school mates both inside and outside of my cohort.
I've met with Justin Pease on most Friday mornings for help and perspective from a senior student.
I've also tried to make little efforts, as a resident of the space, such as not leaving a tp or paper towel rolls empty- generally trying to be a good roommate.
