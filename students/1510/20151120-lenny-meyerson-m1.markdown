### Your Mission
I came to Turing to learn in an immersive environment- to offer single-minded focus to this study for the next seven months. Thus far, the process has been more challenging than I expected but in ways I did not anticipate. Having imagined that my time at Turing would be about learning to program, I believe I focused to narrowly on this subject at the expense of time that might have been spent learning problem solving skills, learning how to learn in this environment, and learning how and when to both ask for and make use of help.

As I continue in the program these neglected aspects must play a larger role in my studies.

Enigma

GitHub URL
Original Assignment
Encryption/decryption machine. Emphasis on breaking program into logical components, TDD and enumerable techniques. Required to build a key generator and date offset, encrypt a message using a 4-digit rotation, decrypt the message using a pre-determined key and crack an encrypted message without the key.

Comments:

Base functionality is all there and seems solid
28 tests; seem to be spread across various objects; probably could use a few more, but overall volume is ok
Lots of opportunities remain to use some more sophisticated enumerables
Watch especially for the map pattern (make empty array, then iteratively push onto the array)
In general we can trim a lot of the methods by relying on enumerables to generate new values rather than having to reassign variables at each step
Some of the methods are getting long and could use some extraction
Watch out for "magic numbers" hanging out -- would like to keep putting semantic names on these
Scores:

Overall Functionality 3
Fundamental Ruby & Style 3
TDD 3
Breaking Logic Into Components 3
Enumerable & Collections 3

Jungle Beats
A drum machine that's backed by a linked list.
Assessed By: Mike

* [Repository:](https://github.com/theobtuseautodidact/jungle_beats)

Notes:

23 runs in tests
need separate file for node test
pop does not work
cannot work with strings, just individual data items
overall clean code, good tail method
some opportunities for refactoring, there are some long methods
Scores:

Overall Functionality: 1
Fundamental Ruby & Style: 3
Test Driven Development: 3
Breaking Logic into Components: 3
Looping and Recursion: 3

Original Assignment
Real-world data collection and analysis. Emphasis on parsing CSV files, extracting data, creating hashes and analyzing that data for specific years, districts and outcomes.

Group: Lenny & Alex

Assessed By: Horace

* [Repository:](https://github.com/Salvi6God/http_yeah_you_know_me)

Notes:

Some initial progress on a procedural solution the problem
Struggled to make layered progress on problem components, largely due to difficulties in applying dev processes and techniques
Struggled with outpacing feedback - no tests to provide feedback, seems to have led to difficulty understanding the progress that had been made thus far and the scope of the problem
Scores:

Overall Functionality 1: Application implements two or fewer iterations
Fundamental Ruby & Style 2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring
Test-Driven Development 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD
Breaking Logic into Components 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### Playing a Part

As something of a socially awkward introvert, I have tried to be part of the community in little way.
I've appreciated Fridays' lunch roulette as an opportunity to get to know school mates both inside and outside of my cohort.
I've also tried to make little efforts, as a resident of the space, such as not leaving a tp or paper towel rolls empty- generally trying to be a good roommate.
