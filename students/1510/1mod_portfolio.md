## Your Mission

Turing gave me the opportunity to learn and create a new career from myself. My mission is a to make

## End of Module Assessment

__Notes:__

* Solid initial workflow
* Getting a little lost when the algorithm gets harder -- need to separate algorithm from implementation
* Some issues with basic syntax
* Trouble building/manipulating hashes and arrays

__Scores:__

*Ruby Syntax & API*
* 2: Developer is generally able to write Ruby, but gets stuck on or needs help with fundamental concepts

*Ruby Style*
* 2: Developer writes code that has unnecessary variables, operations, or steps which do not increase clarity

*Blocks & Enumerations*
* 2: Developer can use enumerator methods, but struggles to choose the right one for the job or demonstrates weak understanding of blocks

*Testing*
* 3: Developer uses tests to guide development in small chunks

*Workflow*
* 3: Developer demonstrates comfort with their tools and makes some use of keyboard shortcuts

*Collaboration*
* 3: Developer lays out their thinking *before* attacking a problem and integrates feedback through the process




## Attendance

I was late to class on Friday, October 30th. I arrived at 9:45am due to my alarm not going off.

## Projects

### Challenge: Jungle Beat

__Instructor:__ Jeff

__Repository:__ https://github.com/Tman22/jungle_beat

__Comments:__

* 15 tests
* Tests look pretty good. Break multiple assertions into multiple tests. Put some more thought into edge cases.
* Implementation is solid with some repetition / opportunity to reuse code. Needs a bit of refactoring.
* Watch out for whitespace

__Scores:__

*Functional Expectations*
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations

*Test-Driven Development*
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into* Components
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP

*Fundamental Ruby & Style*
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring

*Looping or Recursion*
* 3: Application makes effective use of loop/recursion techniques

### Challenge: Enigma

__Instructor:__ Mike

__Repository:__ http://github.com/tman22/new_enigma

__Comments:__

* it works!
* one extension
* 37 tests
* methods generally tested in isolation
* Would like to have seen some edge cases, sad path testing

__Scores:__

1. Overall Functionality:         4
2. Fundamental Ruby & Style:       3
3. TDD: 3
4. Breaking Logic Into Components: 4

### Challenge: Http Yeah You Know Me

__Group:__ James Crockett & Taylor Moore

__Instructor:__ Mike

__Repository::__ http://github.com/tman22/http_stuff

__Comments:__

* 25 tests,
* tests should be structured so that they dont require interactivity
with postman/whatever
* some opportunities to refactor down longer methods, and clear up some
unnecessary variable assignment

__Scores:__

*Overall Functionality*
* 3: Application implements four iterations

*Fundamental Ruby & Style*
* 3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

*Test-Driven Development*
* 3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

*Breaking Logic into Components*
* 3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities

### Challenge: Headcount

__Group:__ Hector Huertas & Taylor Moore

__Instructor:__ Horace

__Repository::__ http://github.com/tman22/http_stuff

__Comments:__

*Functional Expectations*

* 4: Application fulfills all base expectations and two extensions
* 3: Application fulfills all base expectations as tested by the spec harness
* 2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
* 1: Application crashes during normal usage

*Test-Driven Development*

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

*Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components*

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

*Fundamental Ruby & Style*

* 4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

*Enumerable & Collections*

* 4: Application consistently makes use of the best-choice Enumerable methods
* 3: Application demonstrates comfortable use of appropriate Enumerable methods
* 2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
* 1: Application demonstrates deficiencies with Enumerable and struggles with collections

*Code Sanitation*

The output from `rake sanitation:methods` shows...

* 4: Zero complaints
* 3: Five or fewer complaints
* 2: Six to ten complaints
* 1: More than ten complaints


## Community

**Giving Feedback**

Aaron Greenspan is
supportive, intelligent, creative, needs things broken down, responsive, collaborative, helps, works hard to solve complex problems.

Jamie is
intelligent, gets lost but comes back strong, great advice, great at communcating, collaborative,  

Hector is smart, quick to understanding problems and works hard! Occasionally Hector needs to be told to explain his thought process. A weakness of Hector is he knows his process really well but is uncertain when presented with new ideas. Originally I thought it would be hard to work with Hector, but to my surprise it was a great experience and I would happily do it again.

Brant: Great at communicating, shares his opinions, quick to pick up ideas, easy to collaborate with.

**Being a Community Member**

Aaron Greenspan: “Taylor has an impressively sharp and intuitive grasp of deep and/or complex problems.  In our two experiences pairing together, when I wanted to take things slow — write on the white board, create smaller tests, etc —  Taylor was already multiple steps ahead of me.  This is his strength and his weakness, as his difficulty in backing up and taking things slowly sometimes puts Taylor in a situation where he has bitten off more than he can chew.  As a pair partner he is flexible and eager to both learn and contribute. He will bring much value to his group work above and beyond his talents in programming."

Jamie Crockett: "Taylor is super collaborative and comes up with creative solutions to problems, in part because he's very comfortable with less-frequently used enumerables such as 'reduce.' He always strives to create something in the most efficient way possible (which is a good instinct, but sometimes his infatuation with the best possible way distracts him from the bigger picture). He has a calming demeanor that I found easy to work with and communicates expectations well."

Brant Wellman: "To Taylor Moore - "I have paired with Taylor on a couple of exercises where he was an engaged partner and helped contribute to the problems and exercises. He is active in contributing and vocal about what his opinions are, but not at all overbearing. Taylor will continue to be a valuable partner in future pairs by continuing to contribute in this fashion."

**Playing a Part**

I've supported the larger Turing community in these ways:
* Refilled coffee when empty
* Replaced toilet paper when empty
* Provide moral support/technical advice when needed
