### Your Mission

I want to be a solid programmer and a great teacher, and I chose Turing because it could help me become both of these things. I was looking for a rigorous and challenging experience, high standards, and an environment where I had the best chance to fall in love with programming.

I'm ambitious and competitive by nature, but this module I wanted to do things a bit differently. I made it a goal to stay sane in the midst of Turing's pressures, while giving myself time to explore and play with new concepts. I know that it is unrealistic to master Ruby in six weeks, so instead I've focused on learning to learn, course-correct, and build alongside others.

Instructor: Jeff

Repository:

Comments:

Passes spec harness
Passes 26 internal tests
Don't load all the data in tests
Some tests know too much about the implementation -- separate thinking like you separate logic from implementation
Implementation shows good technical understanding
Ease back from ternaries :)
Scores:

Functional Expectations 3
TDD 3
Ruby Style & Fundamentals 3
Encapsulation / Breaking Logic Into Components 3
Enumerable & Collections 3

Mike

Repository:

Comments:

24 tests, well tested, could use some edge cases, sad path tests.
Some commented out tests and comments in code.
some methods were pretty long and could use some refactoring, breaking code out into separate methods.
BST was done iteratively.
Scores:

Functional Expectations (1 - 4): 3
Test-Driven Development (1 - 4): 3
Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components (1 - 4): 3
Fundamental Ruby & Style (1 - 4): 2
Enumerable & Collections (1 - 4): 3

Name: Beth Sebian

Assessed By: Horace

Github Repo: https://github.com/bethsebian/night_writer

Notes:

Basic functionality for encoding text -> braille
Missing read functionality
Encoding makes effective use of a map of characters -> braille glyphs
Encoding process would be improved by relying on enumerators to detect and process text more flexibly rather than expecting known character positions
Overall solid direction but need to get it more finished
Scores:

Overall Functionality - 1
Fundamental Ruby & Style - 2
Test-Driven Development - 2
Breaking Logic into Components - 2

Notes

Great testing overall - quite thorough and voluminous and covering juicy edge cases
Completion is solid through I2; starting to dig into the I3 topics
Code is pretty consistent across the board
Main consistent weaknesses are over-reliance on each as the only iterator and difficulty flattening code branches into more linear steps that can be understood more easily
Has handful of "whoa" methods where things break down in terms of structure, hierarchy, and length
Rubric

1. Functional Expectations

2: Application has some missing functionality but no crashes
2. Test-Driven Development

3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
5. Enumerable & Collections

2: Application demonstrates functional knowledge of Enumerable but only uses the most basic techniques
6. Code Sanitation

The output from rake sanitation:methods shows...

3: Five or fewer complaints

Group: Aaron Greenspan & Beth Sebian

Assessed By: Mike

Github: http://github.com/bethsebian/http_yeah_you_know_me

Notes:

44 tests, all passing
Some weird errors on my computer, but not on Rachels, suspect my computer is wonky.
Fulfills all requirements up to I4.
Well structured code, some minor areas where things could be pulled out into smaller methods
Scores:

Overall Functionality
3: Application implements four iterations

Fundamental Ruby & Style
3: Application shows some effort toward organization but still has 6 or fewer long methods (> 8 lines) and needs some refactoring.

Test-Driven Development
3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality and some edge cases, but fails to break out component objects/tests.

Breaking Logic into Components
3: Application has multiple components with defined responsibilities but there is some leaking of responsibilities
