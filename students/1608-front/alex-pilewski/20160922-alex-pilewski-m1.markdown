# Alex Pilewski - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I wrote in my goals gist from the beginning of the module that I would like a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQUERY. Whatever 'solid foundation' really means is a matter of perspective but I feel good about how much I have learned thus far. I also mentioned that I would like to work on a D3 side project, familiarize myself with good workflows, and start building a tech network. On all of those fronts (some more than others) there have been steps in the right direction.

## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

There were 4 evaluated projects this module. In order of completion: number-guesser, linked-list, idea-box, and game-time. There was also one un-evaluated project, color-changer.

**number-guesser**
* https://github.com/Pilewski/number-guesser

- Three button interface game that checks if a user guesses a randomly generated number.

**Evaluation**

**Functional Expectations**
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three

**Fundamental JavaScript Style**
2.5: Application runs but the code has long functions, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring

**jhun notes:** Strong effort towards writing good javascript. Some opportunities to refactor and reuse code. Would be beneficial for devs to go back and refactor with a mentor.

***

**linked-list**
* https://github.com/Pilewski/linked-list

- Application with two input fields that adds bookmarks to a page.
- Bookmarks feature the title, URL, and buttons to "mark as read" and "remove".

**Evaluation**

**Functional Expectations**
4: Application meets all of the functional expectations in Phase Three.

**HTML Style**
4: Developer is able to craft HTML that is semantically correct and clearly organized. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach. Developer writes markup that is exceptionally clear and well-factored. Application is expertly organized and logically structured with with a clear, thoughtful use of tags and selectors.

**CSS Style**
4: Application has exceptionally well-factored CSS with little or no duplication and all styles separated out into logical stylesheets. There are zero instances where an instructor would recommend taking a different approach.

**Fundamental Javascript Style**
3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring.

**Workflow**
4: The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

**jhun notes:**
developers are referencing the document multiple times
could refactor to use closures
good solid effort.
great workflow! Bazillion commits for the win!
no globals for the win!

***

**idea-box**
* https://github.com/Pilewski/ideabox

- An application to store ideas of varying qualities.
- Application uses JS and JQuery to manage client-side interactions and JSON and localStorage to persist data between sessions.
- Ideas have id, title, body, and qualities. They are appended to the page and displayed in a friendly UI.
- Project replicates given design layouts.
- Our application also featured both extensions: the ability to add tags to our ideas and the ability to sort our ideas by quality.

**Evaluation**

**Specification Adherence**
4 - The application meets all of the requirements listed above and implements one or more of the extensions.

Completed all extensions

**User Interface**
4 - The application is pleasant, logical, and easy to use. There no holes in functionality and the application stands on it own to be used by the instructor without guidance from the developer.

**JavaScript Style**
3- Application is thoughtfully put together with some duplication and no major bugs. Developer can speak to choices made in the code and knows what every line of code is doing.

**Workflow**
4 - The developer effectively uses Git branches and many small, atomic commits that document the evolution of their application.

## E: Feedback and Community Participation

### Giving Feedback

Feedback to Maia:
Maia is the bomb. Always exudes kindness and joy (even when she has not had her morning cup of joe!) I relish the opportunity to pick her brain and we have had great conversations about the communities we belong to and our responsibilities to them. Very gracious with her attention and I imagine I would enjoy being paired with Maia on any  project!

### Being a Community Member

Feedback from Kristen:
I was incredibly lucky to work with Alex on our first project of the module, Number Guesser. He is an exceptional student of this trade that works hard to master the craft of writing code. Alex had such a stronger grasp on the workings of Javasript than I did at this early point in the program, and I cannot express enough how much I appreciated his patience with me throughout the project. Not only is he impressive as a student, he's also a great teacher. He painstakingly walked me through every line of code that was written, helping me establish my foundationional understanding of JavaScript. In additon to being a partner who is intelligent and insightful, Alex is also highly entertaining. Whether struggling through a problem in the code or explaining an overarching concept, his demeanor and verbiage is always engaging and delightful.  

Feedback from Matt:
Working with Alex on IdeaBox was a pleasure. He has a good knowledge of Javascript and is engaging to work with. Alex focuses well, was always on time, and overall super friendly. Our project went smoothly, we had good communication, and he helped me understand more git concepts that I didn't know before. I hope to work with Alex again in the future.

Feedback from Graham:
Alex was my partner for Linked List, the second team project of the mod. From day 1, we seemed to be on the same page; I found that my workflow with Alex was the best of all of my team experiences for the mod. Alex had a lot of insights and has a great sense of humor to boot. I hope we are paired up again in the future.

Feedback from Adam:
Alex and I were paired for the Gametime project. Alex is a very hard worker and great team player. He was willing to slowly breakdown any problems that he solved if I did not understand how he got to a solution. Alex does not get frustrated easily so it is easy to work with him.

### Playing a Part

Creation of Dale memes, willingness to make a fool of myself, willingness to teach and help others, commitment to growth mindsets, being a good roommate, and making deliberate choices.
