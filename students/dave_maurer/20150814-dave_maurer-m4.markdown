# Dave Maurer - M4 Portfolio

## Individual

### Areas of Emphasis

I wanted to understand more about how the MVC concept works in Rails, and the why behind the steps we take to build
functional web facing apps. I have been listening to one Rubyrogues podcast per day, which is 
helping me to learn the "language" of web frameworks. The next step is to finish the Hartl tutorial.

To improve fundamental understanding of Ruby, logical thinking process, and problem solving.
I save three solutions from each warmup challenge and study the different approaches used.
It has helped, but not as much as actual implementation would. My plan for next module is to
attempt and solve at least two exercisms per week.

### End of Module Assessment



### Attendance

All classes attended sans one Friday on July 31st where I left at 2:30 in order to beat traffic home and 
get in a much needed full workout. I only find time for those one weekends usually, so take
advantage when I can, and I feel that my presence or lack thereof will not be a detriment to
the school.

### Work

Individual Projects:

####Rales Engine

A Rails implementation of the Sales Engine Model

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davemaurer/rails_engine)
* [Production URL](http://glacial-waters-5604.herokuapp.com)

Completion: 2.5 - Project completes most requirements but fails 4 or fewer spec harness tests
Rails and ActiveRecord Style: 3 - Project makes good use of ActiveRecord to fulfill Business Reqs, but drops to ruby enumerables for some query methods
Ruby Style and Code Quality: 3 - Project uses idiomatic Ruby with a handful of larger methods or bloated controllers controllers
API Design: 3 - Project uses strong and consistent data formats throughout, while relying mostly on standard Rails JSON features
Test Driven Design: 3 - Project has solid test coverage at multiple levels of the application, but skips some edge cases or complicated methods


####APIcurious

The purpose was to build a clone of the chosen service's functionality. I chose Twitter.

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/davemaurer/twitter-feed)
* [Production URL](https://murmuring-plains-3238.herokuapp.com)

Server-Side Application and APIs: 2.5 - Project wraps/isolates external API but has some gaps or external connections in its testing.
Test-Driven Development: 1.5 - The code demonstrates high test coverage (>60%), but does not adequately balance feature and unit tests.
Features: 3 - All planned features were delivered.
Interface: 2.5 - The application covers many interactions of the target application, but has a few holes in lesser-used functionality.

## Team

### Projects

Group Projects:

####Supper Skip

The end goal was to apply another layer of functionality with multi-tenancy on an inherited
Dinner Dash project. 

Group members: Dave Maurer, Brett Grigsby, Rick Bacci

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/brettgrigsby/supper_skip)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/supper_skip.markdown)

Feature Completion - 2: Is missing some base features
Project Organization - 3: Team generally makes good use of git and project workflow, but has a few "git dump" PRs or dropped tickets
Test-Driven Development - 3: Solid test coverage. Slightly heavier reliance on one layer over another, and some gaps, but important features are generally well-covered.
Code Quality - 3: Solid code quality. A few small leaks of responsibility, but logic is pushed down the stack and generally clearly encapsulated.
User Experience - 2: Some gaps in the UX

### Feedback to me

Several students have remarked that I know more than I think I do, and my hesitancy to try
to complete things myself is tied to my own lack of confidence. I believe this to be partly true,
and as part of my personal project, I've taken on things that are well out of what I would consider
my comfort area. Consuming an API without a gem or clear documentation was something I wanted 
to achieve for myself. I have also been told I'm very helpful when I understand a concept, such
as Heroku deployment, and can explain it clearly from several perspectives. I have since sought to 
actively engage those struggling with concepts I have knowledge of, instead of waiting for them
to come to me for help.

## Community

### Giving Feedback

I participate in every survey, and take the time to fully answer the questions with the intent 
of impacting Turing in a positive way. I try to give positive reinforcement to everyone I come 
into contact with, and am at my best when helping others to see that a few small steps will get
them across what seems like an impassable chasm at first.

### Playing a Part

* I have given resume advice and helped review resumes for two students in my cohort. In addition,
I gave interview prep advice to a student nervous about the kinds of questions they would be asked. 
I also coached Jeffrey Gu on interview answer techniques by going through his past interviews with
him and sharing my experiences from IT recruiting.
* I have volunteered my time at many points to help students with small problems, and helped 
a student for over an hour via screen hero on a weekend where she was stuck on a file I/O issue 
for her assignment. 
* I'm working on a Git tutorial to help beginners start off with a good workflow process, 
and understand the basic Git commands.
* Provided the volleyball net, outdoor stereo, cooler full of gatorade, hose for filling water balloons,
football, volleyballs, and pump for the Turing student field day.
* I spent after hours school time on two occasions helping student teams with gitastrophies, then showing 
them proper Git flow and Git commands so that they could pass the knowledge on.
* I will contribute to learning at turing by creating a screencast of my lightning talk about
the 7 data-types most encountered in Ruby.
* With the help of my mentor Sean, I created a bot for the Turing Slack team that can monitor channels 
for the word poop or a poop emoji, and punish Jack Yeh for pooping in multiple channels using Horace's
computer while he was away from it. Over three hours of my own time was spend on this project(It took Sean
15 minutes to redo what I had done, but in a better way).

## Review

There are many things I would like to do at Turing, but I feel unqualified for many of them. Examples 
are teaching at the local schools, contributing to open source, leading student sessions, and 
creating entire tutorials focused on good process when approaching Ruby, Rails, etc.

I am a slow learner when it comes to programming, and naturally hesitant when I feel I am 
not good at something. However, I know I am progressing, and believe my impact on Turing is growing 
with each Module, and each concept I gain competency with. As I expand my knowledge base, I am confident 
I will be able to make bigger and more positive impacts on Turing, and the programming community in general.
