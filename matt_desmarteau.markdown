# Matt DesMarteau - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Attendance

Although sometimes sleep deprived, I  was able to attended each and every day.

### Work

Module 1 was an intense programming experience.  My experience working individually was challenging due to the amount of information to process in such a short time.  Module 1 really challenges how you push yourself as an individual.  There was a tremendous amount of individual research and learning during lunch or after school to keep up with the class work and projects.  Proper time management was tested constantly and became apparent within the end of the first week how important it would be for success in the program. I learned a wealth of information about OO programming as well as strengthening my all around individual skill sets in learning complex ideas and time management.
