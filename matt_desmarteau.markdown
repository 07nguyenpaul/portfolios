# Matt DesMarteau - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Learn the skills necessary to change my professional career from Account Manager in an unrewarding non ethical industry to follow my passions of creating from scratch and building things people can use, and to have my professional success depend more on the personal abilities acquired as I grow within programming industry.

### Attendance

I  was able to attended each and every day of Module 1.

### Work

Module 1 was an intense programming experience.  Module 1 really challenges how you push yourself as an individual.  My experience working individually was challenging due to the amount of information to process in such a short period of time.  There was a tremendous amount of individual research and learning during lunch and after school to keep up with the class work and projects.  Proper time management was tested constantly and became apparent by the end of the first week how important it would be for success in the program.  I learned a wealth of information about OO programming and strengthened my individual skill sets in time management, problem solving, and breaking complex ideas into manageable tasks.  


### Individual Project - Enigma

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/MDes41/Enigma)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/b38606f60fd77e4bf64e6c33d922c90f3cdfa4dc/source/projects/enigma.markdown)

In this project we used Ruby to build a tool for cracking an encryption algorithm.

####Learning Goals / Areas of Focus

* Practice breaking a program into logical components
* Testing components in isolation and in combination
* Applying Enumerable techniques in a real context
* Reading text from and writing text to files

####Evaluation Rubric
Assessed By: Meeka

####1. Overall Functionality

3: Application encrypts, decrypts, and cracks files as described (works well - just didn't do an extension)

####2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring (Matt was able to speak to places that he refactored and explain why and how)

####3. Test-Driven Development

3: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality, but has some gaps in coverage or leaves edge cases untested. (Had a decent test suit, but did not cover any sad paths)

####4. Breaking Logic into Components

4: Application effectively breaks logical components apart with clear intent and usage (Did a great job of doing this)

**Feedback from Meeka:**
Matt had a good understanding of what was going on, I gave him some advice on the correct places to leave comments in ruby code.

### Working in Teams

In my previous experience as an Account Manager, I was the point man for 4-to-6 employees. I acquired valuable skills in communicating and managing a team. There were times I needed to settle temperamental employee disagreements and make sure all of my employees were giving 100% effort.  While working in teams in Module 1 I learned the difference between directly working on technical problems and meeting deadlines with an individual vs managing an individual directly.

Working in teams on a programming project requires you to know the individual on a personal level.  You need to know what works best for them and what they are distracted by.  After the first pairing in Module 1, I learned that communicating your ideas and standing up for a process that works for the team is way more important than avoiding conflicts.  Conflicts can always be resolved, but left unsaid, they will always lead to failures.  Although it is hard to tell someone what is not working for you, it is necessary in paired programming.  Although there are may ways to tackle a problem, paired programming requires you to find a process that works for both of you.  If you are not persistent in figuring out what process works for both of you, you will not succeed.

#### Team Projects - HTTP Yeah You Know Me

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/marinacor1/HTTP)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/http_yeah_you_know_me.markdown)

In this project we were introduced to HTTP, the protocol that runs the web, and built a functioning web server to put that understanding into action.

####Learning Goals

* Practice breaking a workflow into a system of coordinating components
* Practice using TDD at the unit, integration, and acceptance levels
* Understand how the HTTP request/response cycle works
* Practice implementing basic HTTP requests and responses

####Evaluation Rubric

####1. Overall Functionality

2: Application implements three iteration

####2. Fundamental Ruby & Style

2: Application runs but the code has many long methods (>8 lines) and needs significant refactoring

####3. Test-Driven Development

2: Application uses tests to exercise core functionality but leaves many common edge cases untested.

####4. Breaking Logic into Components

2: Application has some logical components but divisions of responsibility are inconsistent or unclear and/or there is a "God" object taking too much responsibility
Feedback from Horace:


Feedback from Horace:
* Top-level server request/response loop algorithm is cleanly written and easy to follow; however it is currently just spread across a lengthy top-level loop in the project's main namespace
* Project generally suffers from long and complicated methods. most of the concepts are there but the code needs to be cleaned up and extracted into at least more methods and probably more objects as well
* Additionally the implementation relies on a lot of "magic numbers" - especially hardcoding specific array indices for certain data etc.; would like to see more of this extracted into variables and methods so that we can give them names that describe why they're so important to the algorithm
