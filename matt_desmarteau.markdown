# Matt DesMarteau - M1 Portfolio

## Individual

### Your Mission

Learn more than just the basics necessary to change my professional career from Account Management in the oil and gas industry to a career in programming.

### End of Module Assessment

(Notes & scores from your assessment rubric)

### Attendance

Although sometimes sleep deprived, I  was able to attended each and every day.

### Work

Module 1 was an intense programming experience.  Module 1 really challenges how you push yourself as an individual.  My experience working individually was challenging due to the amount of information to process in such a short period of time.  There was a tremendous amount of individual research and learning during lunch and after school to keep up with the class work and projects.  Proper time management was tested constantly and became apparent by the end of the first week how important it would be for success in the program. I learned a wealth of information about OO programming as well as strengthening my all around individual skill sets in learning complex ideas and time management.
